ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The Ricoh CX5 is the fifth in a line of CX compacts that goes back to the CX1, released in early 2009. The CX5 re-introduces the company's AF system that combines a distance sensor with more conventional contrast detection method to offer focus times of as little as 0.2sec regardless of focal length. Its 10MP back-illuminated CMOS sensor is twice as sensitive to conventional CMOS sensors and the 10.7x zoom lens fits into a compact body with a thickness of 29.4mm using Ricoh's retracting lens system. It also offers 14 scene modes and six filters for a variety of effects including Cross Process and Toy Camera. It also records standard 720p HD videos.
