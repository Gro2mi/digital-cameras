ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: Canon's PowerShot G-series is one of the most iconic lines of digital compact cameras, with the original G1 having debuted right back in September 2000. Typically, G-series models over the years have sported fast lenses, articulated LCDs, optical viewfinders, Raw data recording and lots of external control, and were aimed at enthusiasts.The PowerShot G15 is a successor to the popular G12 and is built around a 12MP, 1/1.7" CMOS sensor. Its lens also gets an upgrade - retaining its 28-140mm range but now with a maximum aperture of F1.8-2.8. It loses the G12's articulated screen but gains a higher-resolution, 920k dot panel.

    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: Photographers who want DSLR-like controls and build-quality in a pocketable package
        NotSoGoodFor: Video shooters or users who cannot live without an articulated screen
        Conclusion: The Canon Powershot G15 is a well-refined product and a joy to use. It is very quick and responsive in operation, built like a tank and offers the most external controls in its class. In combination with the fast 28-140mm F1.8-2.8 lens that makes it a very versatile and pocketable photographic tool that offers almost the same degree of control as much larger DSLRs.
