ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The FinePix Real 3D W3 is Fujifilm's second 3D compact camera, and the first to shoot movies in HD. It inherits the same techonology including dual 10MP CCD sensors and twin lenses from the W1, but comes with a larger 3.5"" 3D LCD compared to the 2.8"" screen of the previous model. It offers a new Auto 3D mode and records sound in stereo. Images and videos taken with the camera can be viewed on 3D televisions and the company's 3D photo frames.
