ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The M-E is Leica's entry-level rangefinder model, with a feature set that's nearly identical to the Leica M-9, and based around the same 18MP full frame CCD sensor. It doesn't offer the M-9's built-in USB port, but keeps pace with an identical 2 frames per second continuous shooting mode, built-in flash with hot shoe and classic rangefinder design.
