ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The Sigma DP2s compact camera is built around a 14MP FOVEON  X3 CMOS sensor. With almost identical specifications to its predecessor, the DP2, it offers a new AF algorithm for faster autofocus, a Power Save mode and a slightly revised rear design with more visible labeling of the buttons. The camera will ship with the company's latest Photo Pro 4.0 raw processing software.
