ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The Sony Cyber-shot DSC-RX1R is a variation of the RX1, which had the impressive distinction of being the first full frame fixed lens camera to enter the market. The variation of the RX1R (the R stands for "resolution"), is that it lacks the anti-aliasing filter of its counterpart. Optical low-pass filters minimize moire and color artifacts, but slightly soften images. With the absence of that filter, the RX1R gains sharpness and higher effective resolution, but may require more post-processing to counteract moire.That sizable 24.3MP sensor is paired with a 35mm F2 lens outfitted with a dedicated aperture ring. A high resolution 1.23 million dot display is provided, as is an accessory hot shoe able to accept both the FDA-V1K optical viewfinder and FDA-EV1MK electronic viewfinder accessories. A dedicated button stops and starts 1080 HD video recording.
