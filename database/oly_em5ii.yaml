    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: Committed photographers wanting an attractive, engaging camera with solid stills and video capability and quick access to every setting. Enthusiasts who already own Micro Four Thirds lenses.
        NotSoGoodFor: Demanding users seeking the absolute best possible image quality. Dedicated videographers needing pro-grade footage.
        Conclusion: The E-M5 II is a great all-rounder that improves over its well-respected predecessor in almost every respect. Although it faces stiff competition from higher-resolution peers in this segment of the mirrorless market, the combination of a deep feature set, extensive customization and enthusiast-friendly ergonomics make it a strong contender.
