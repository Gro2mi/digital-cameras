ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The Canon PowerShot G12 is a premium compact digital camera, and the successor to the PowerShot G11 released last year. Inheriting most of the core features of the G11, the latest model sees the addition of an EOS-style front control dial, Hybrid IS for close-up work, and 720p HD video recording. It also adds multi-aspect ratio shooting and SDXC card compatibility. The rest of the features remain the same including a 28-140mm equivalent lens, 2.8" tilt and swivel LCD, manual control and RAW shooting.

    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: Enthusiasts who want the maximum manual control in a compact (ish) package
        NotSoGoodFor: Video enthusiasts, or anyone looking for a slim, portable compact.
        Conclusion: The G12 is an excellent compact camera, with a proven 10MP CCD sensor and effective ergonomics. Fans of 'hands-on' photography will love the big chunky dials, and the addition of a front control dial makes the G12 easier to get to grips with than its most recent predecessors. Our only significant concern is with the G12's uninspiring movie mode.
