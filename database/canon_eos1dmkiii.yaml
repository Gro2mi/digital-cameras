ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: Launched in 2007 as 'the world's fastest D-SLR', the EOS-1D Mark III offered 10 megapixels at 10 fps (still one of the highest burst rates on the market) and a wealth of upgrades from the Mark II. Plagued by reports of autofocus problems (now fixed) and somewhat overshadowed by the Nikon D3, the Mark III was replaced in 2009 by the acclaimed Mark IV
