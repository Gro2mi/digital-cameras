ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The Olympus Tough TG-810 rugged compact features a built-in GPS, electronic compass and manometer (air/water pressure gauge). Sporting the same 14MP sensor, 28-140mm equivalent zoom lens and 920K dot 3.0" LCD of the recently released TG-610, but in a tougher body. It is dustproof, waterproof to 10m (33 ft), shockproof to 2m (6.6 ft) and freezeproof to -10 C (14 F). It can record 720p HD video recording and a two-shot 3D option that can even be used in underwater mode.

    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: Go-anywhere photography and videography - the TG810 is one of the toughest cameras around
        NotSoGoodFor: Critical image quality and fast operation - two areas in which the TG-810 is only average.
        Conclusion: The Olympus TG-810 is one of the heftiest 'rugged' cameras available in 2011, with a distinctly utilitarian body design that includes some chunky controls ideal for tougher shooting situations. However, in terms of image quality, the TG-810 is a little behind the top performers in this class and, for the price, there are better options available.
