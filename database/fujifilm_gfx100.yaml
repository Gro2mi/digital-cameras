ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The Fujifilm GFX 100 is a medium format camera with a whopping 102 Megapixel BSI-CMOS sensor. The camera has 5-axis in-body image stabilization, a hybrid autofocus system with nearly 100% coverage and both DCI and UHD 4K video with 10-bit 4:2:2 output. The robust body is weather-sealed, has OLED info displays on the top and rear plates, and sports a built-in grip that holds a pair of batteries. Its dual-hinged 3.2" LCD can tilt for both landscape and portrait photography, and an large, ultra-high-res tilting EVF can be attached. The camera has two SD card slots and ports for a mic, headphones and remote control.

    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: People who need 100MP and top-notch image quality in and out of the studio.
        NotSoGoodFor: Anyone needing speed or convenience rather than pushing for the boundaries of attainable image quality.
        Conclusion: The GFX 100 is a highly specialized tool, and yet one that Fujifilm has worked on to make as flexible and capable as possible. It offers very high resolution, supported by good glass and image stabilization to let you exploit that resolution far beyond the studio. It's not an all-rounder like some of the high-res full-frame mirrorless cameras can be, but it does things you wouldn't expect of a 100MP medium format camera.
