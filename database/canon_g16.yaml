ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The Canon PowerShot G16 caters to an advanced shooter with a 12MP 1/1.7"-type sensor, larger than that of a typical point-and-shoot, matched with a fast 28-140mm (equivalent) F1.8-2.8 lens. Full 1080p/60p video recording is available in MP4 format, and the High Speed AF mode offers improved autofocus speeds while maintaining 12.2 / 9.3 FPS continuous shooting (depending how many frames you shoot). The G16 has a new flexible aspect ratio while still letting the user shoot uncompressed RAW images. Using  the PowerShot’s built-in Wi-Fi in conjunction with Canon’s Camera Window app on your iOS or Android device (or Canon Image gateway on a PC), you can wirelessly share your images.
