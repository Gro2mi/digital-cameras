    ExecutiveSummary: The Canon EOS 80D features an all-new 24.2MP APS-C CMOS sensor, 45-point all cross-type autofocus system, and the company's DIGIC 6 processor.

Wi-Fi is also built in, with support for NFC technology.

    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: Any enthusiast seeking a camera that can handle both still and video capture with great ease.
        NotSoGoodFor: Sports and action shooters needing reliable subject tracking capabilities.
        Conclusion: The Canon 80D centers around ease of use. It offers the best dynamic range of any APS-C Canon camera to date and features dual pixel AF, allowing for continuous focus during both video and still capture. The articulating touchscreen is especially handy in  live view mode. And while the camera's  image quality and video resolution lag behind the competition, the 80D is still a solid choice for enthusiasts.
