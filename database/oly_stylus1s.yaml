ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The Olympus Stylus 1s  pairs a larger-than-average 1/1.7" BSI-CMOS sensor with an F2.8, 28-300mm zoom lens, high resolution electronic viewfinder, 'hybrid' control ring, and Wi-Fi. The control ring can be toggled between digital or analog mode. In digital mode, the ring adjusts zooming or manual focusing; in analog, it adjusts settings such as aperture, shutter speed and more. The camera is also equipped with a hot shoe for accessories, built-in flash, a side zoom lever with variable speeds and a step-zoom function, and two customizable function buttons for easy access to commonly used settings.  Other notable features include a built-in ND filter, tilting touchscreen LCD, built-in Wi-Fi, and 1080p movie recording. All of these features are packed into a compact body that resembles the popular Olympus OM-D EM-5 even more than the original Stylus 1.
