ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The ZS5, like its predecessors, is a solid and pleasantly weighty metal-bodied camera with a   good selection of exterior control points, complemented by a reasonably   clear menu system.The 12MP ZS5 packs a useful 25-300mm   (equivalent) lens which is amongst the most versatile currently on the market. As far as image quality is concerned, the ZS5 turns in   excellent results overall, and output is towards the   top end of the models in its segment of the market in terms of detail reproduction and   optical sharpness. Despite the impressive breadth of its feature set, one of the most   appealing things about the ZS5 is that it is very reliable. If   you're not feeling too adventurous, just switch the dial to 'iAuto'.

    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: Go-everywhere, do-everything shooting
        NotSoGoodFor: Sun-worshippers. The ZS5's uncoated LCD screen isn't great in bright sunlight.
        Conclusion: The Panasonic Lumix DMC-ZS5 is an excellent camera with a very versatile lens that combines the best aspects of previous ZS-series compacts with some very useful newer features like intelligent auto and iExposure modes. Effective image stabilization and great sharpness make the ZS5, like it's big brother the ZS7, an excellent travel companion.
