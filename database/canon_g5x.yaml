ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The Canon PowerShot G5 X uses the same 20.2MP 1" CMOS sensor and 24-100mm equivalent F1.8-2.8 lens as its G7 X sibling, but goes a step further with a built-in 2.36M dot OLED EVF. Its 3" 1.04M dot touch screen LCD is fully articulated, and true to its enthusiast class offers a top panel exposure compensation dial, front and rear command dials, as well as a control ring around the lens. A pop-up flash is provided.

    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: Those who want good image quality in a small body that has an EVF and many direct controls.
        NotSoGoodFor: Those who want to shoot all day without a battery change, shoot bursts of Raw images or want to photograph moving subjects.
        Conclusion: The PowerShot G5 X is a well-designed and easy-to-use premium compact that takes good quality photos and videos and offers a nice EVF and LCD on which to compose them. It's subpar battery life, so-so lens and sluggish continuous Raw shooting keep it from being a top choice.
