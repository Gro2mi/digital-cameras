ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The Kodak-branded S-1 produced by licensee JK Imaging is a Micro Four Thirds camera with a 16MP sensor. It offers 5 fps burst shooting, 3.0-inch 920k-dot monitor and a 12-45mm F3.5-5.6 kit lens. Although pitched as an entry-level offering, the S-1 does offer a decent feature set, including film emulation modes and RAW capture in the DNG format.
