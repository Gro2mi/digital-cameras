ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The Sony Alpha a9 II is the company's sports-oriented full-frame mirrorless camera. It features a 24MP stacked CMOS sensor which permits 20 fps burst shooting without the 'blackout' found on traditional DSLRs courtesy of its electronic shutter (it can shoot at 10 fps with its mechanical shutter). Its 693-point phase-detect covering 93% of the image area and features Sony's latest Real-Time Tracking system. The camera has an ISO range of 50-204,800 when fully expanded and 14-bit uncompressed Raws can be saved. It can also record oversampled UHD 4K video.The redesigned magnesium alloy body, reminiscent of the a7R IV, is weather-sealed, has onboard 5-axis image stabilization, and offers two dials plus a joystick for selecting an AF point. The large EVF has 3.7 million dots and the tilting 3" LCD is touch-enabled. The a9 sports two SD card slots (both support UHS-II media) plus Gigabit Ethernet and USB 3.2 ports allowing users to transfer files over FTP (even in the background). Sony has updated its Wi-Fi system to support the 5Ghz band. The camera can store up to seven sets of camera and FTP settings, allowing for multiple photographers to use the same body the way they want.

    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: Sports, action and event photography specialists, run-and-gun video shooters that need solid out-of-camera footage and generalist photographers that want the best autofocus performance they can find.
        NotSoGoodFor: Landscape and studio purists that may need more resolution or dynamic range, high-end video shooters that need more flexible files in post-production.
        Conclusion: The Sony Alpha 9 Mark II comes with the best autofocus system we've seen. It's compact yet has a good-sized grip, produces great Raw and JPEG files, offers excellent battery life and solid video capture. That said, we do think its video capabilities and rear screen could be updated, and of course, this is a sports camera, so those looking for maximum resolution or dynamic range are barking up the wrong tree. But the a9 II meets and, in some cases, exceeds the capabilities of its peers and makes for a truly compelling value for sports and action photographers.
