ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The Leica Q2 updates its predecessor with a higher resolution full-frame sensor, splash and dust resistance on par with the SL's and an updated OLED viewfinder. The Q2 offers a 47.3MP full-frame sensor capable of DCI and UHD 4K video recording, and sticks with the stabilized 28mm F1.7 offered on the first Q. Bluetooth LE for easy connectivity has been added, and a higher capacity battery yields a CIPA rating of 370 shots per charge.

    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: Street, travel and casual photography as well as landscape photographers that make use of medium wide-angle lenses.
        NotSoGoodFor: Sports and action photographers that require longer focal lengths, and those that require a more robust video feature set.
        Conclusion: The Leica Q2 is nearly as competent as a fixed-lens digital camera can be. It's built very well, it handles very well, it's capable of excellent image quality and it's a joy to use. We wish Leica would address the lackluster JPEGs, but the Raw files are excellent. It all comes at a price, of course, but the Q2 really is a wonderfully engaging photographic tool that will appeal to photographers of all kinds.
