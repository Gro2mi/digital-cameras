ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: After a carefully constructed teaser campaign Olympus officially launched the E-P1, its first Micro Four Thirds camera in June 2009.The E-P1 is a compact mirrorless interchangeable lens camera that mimics the styling of the company's Pen range that was popular in the 1960s and 70s. The camera is built around an image-stabilized 12 megapixel sensor and incorporates a 3.0"" LCD, but lacks a built-in viewfinder of any sort, or a flash. Arguments will continue to rage about the E-P1's relatively conservative feature set and performance but few could find any serious fault with its image quality, which is easily as good as most SLRs at a similar price point. Yes, it's fractionally noisier than the best APS-C models (particularly if you turn the noise filter off to get the maximum detail), and yes, the dynamic range isn't as good as the very best-in-class cameras, but honestly we're splitting hairs here. Our overall impression of the E-P1's image quality was and remains overwhelmingly positive.

    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: Walkaround camera for landscapes, SLR users wanting something pocketable with excellent image quality
        NotSoGoodFor: Low light, indoor or action/sports/wildlife photography
        Conclusion: It's hard not to fall for the E-P1's charms. The unashamedly nostalgic design combines with true SLR quality in a remarkably pocketable package. The lack of flash and viewfinder will put some off, as will the relatively slow focus, but overall this bodes very well indeed for the new system.
