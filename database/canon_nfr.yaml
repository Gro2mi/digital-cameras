ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: Canon's PowerShot N Facebook ready is a variant of the company's social media-focused compact.  This version includes the 'either way up' design and Creative Shot processing filters of the conventional model and includes a dedicated Facebook button, rather than a connect-to-devices button. Canon's talking about it as a companion to a smartphone, and to this end it includes Wi-Fi connectivity and the ability to upload photos and videos.
