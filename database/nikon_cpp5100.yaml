ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: Minor refresh of Nikon's flagship compact concentrates on improving performance, though it still feels pretty sluggish in use. The compact styling, useful (if slightly unambitious) 35-125mm equiv. 3.6x zoom, extensive manual controls and excellent build quality make it an appealing pocket camera for the serious photographer. It's capable of excellent results in the right conditions, but in low light it's painfully slow (and the results not worth the wait). A great landscape camera for the committed enthusiast wanting something small - and not too expensive - but one it's hard to recommend for more general uses.
