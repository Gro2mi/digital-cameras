ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The Nikon D7200 is an updated version of the venerable D7100. Its design and build quality remains the same but it gains a faster processor, much larger buffer for continuous shooting, improved low light autofocus performance, and Wi-Fi with NFC. Battery life has also gone up by more than 15%. The camera features a 24.2MP CMOS sensor with no optical low-pass filter, which maximizes resolution. It has an ISO range of 100-25600 that expands up to 102400 in black & white only. The autofocus system remains 51-points with 15 cross-type sensors but now all of those points can focus down to -3EV. Continuous shooting remains at 6 fps (7 fps in 1.3x crop mode) but the D7200 can take much longer bursts thanks to that larger buffer. Other features include a 3.2" 1.2M dot LCD, large optical viewfinder with 100% coverage, and 1080/60p video (in crop mode only), and an enhanced time-lapse feature.

    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: Anyone looking for a traditional, well-featured DSLR for stills shooting.
        NotSoGoodFor: Videographers and, perhaps, travel shooters might do better looking elsewhere.
        Conclusion: The D7200 is a gentle refresh of an excellent camera. The sensor sees improvements in dynamic range, AF works in lower light and the continuous shooting buffer lets you make use of its class-leading subject tracking. The slow live view autofocus and awkward lack of aperture control during movie shooting means it's not as flexible as some of its rivals but it's a formidable DSLR for stills work.
