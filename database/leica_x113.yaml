    ExecutiveSummary: 'Manufacturer description: To create optimum image quality, the Leica X pairs an APS-C-Format CMOS Sensor with 16.5 megapixels (effective 16.2 megapixels) with a Summilux 23 mm f/1.7 ASPH lens. Delivering clear, sharp photos from infinity to a close focusing distance of .2 meters, the improved lens design minimizes flare and ghosting effects. Equivalent to the focal length of a 35mm lens on a full frame, 35mm sensor, the 23mm lens on an APS-C sensor allows for classic wide-angle photography. When using the Leica Digiscoping Adapter on the Leica APO-Televid 82 and APO-Televid 65 spotting scopes, the X camera enables wildlife watchers and photographers to create stunning images with a variable focal length from 850 to 3100 mm.The simplified functionality and new menu layout permits intuitive camera handling and ease in switching from automatic to manual modes. A faster, more precise auto focus ensures the perfect photo is never missed. Capable of capturing full-HD quality video at a resolution of 1920 x 1080 pixels and 30 full frames per second in MP4 format, the new Leica X provides everything an amateur or professional photographer needs for commercial, small business or family use.A fusion of highest-quality magnesium and aluminum with premium leather trim, the Leica X body comes in a discreet black version with matching leather trim or in an elegant silver with brown leather trim. An extensive range of technical accessories, bags and cases are available for the Leica X wherever the camera is sold'
