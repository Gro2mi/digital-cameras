ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The pocketable RICOH GR II features the same core specifications as the older GR, which means the same excellent 28mm equivalent F2.8 lens and 16MP APS-C sensor. The white-balance algorithm of the Mark II has been tweaked to improve the precision of Auto White Balance control and fine-tuning of the compensation program to prevent high-sensitivity noise. It has also been designed to accommodate a wider variety of scenes and subjects by adding new creative tools, including six effect modes and a wireless flash discharge function in combination with an external flash unit. The GR II is also the first GR-series model to feature Wi-Fi and NFC (Near Field Communication) functions for easy pairing with smartphones and other mobile devices.
