    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: Established photographers looking for a compact system or newcomers looking to grow, JPEG shooters and those looking for abundant manual controls.
        NotSoGoodFor: People looking to shoot fast action or video.
        Conclusion: The Fujifilm X-E2S is an engaging camera for those with some photographic experience, or for newcomers looking for a camera to grow into. The build quality, controls and handling are all excellent, the trademark Fujifilm JPEG output remains a staff favorite and the lens ecosystem offers a wide selection of quality lenses. The video specification, autofocus system and some aspects of operational speed are starting to show their age, but overall, the X-E2S has a lot to offer at its price point.
