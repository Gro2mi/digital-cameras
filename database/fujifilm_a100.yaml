ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: Fujifilm's budget 'A' series cameras have got a lot more stylish - and a lot slimmer - in recent years, but the basic feature set remains just that; basic. The 10 megapixel A100 (along with slightly higher spec sibling the A150) offers a fairly stylish and easy to use entry point to digital photography from a well-respected brand at an undeniably low price, even if the modest 3x zoom and  point-and-shoot functionality are slightly underwhelming.
