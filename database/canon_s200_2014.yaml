ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The PowerShot S200 is a cheaper version of the S110, utilizing a 10.1 megapixel CCD instead of a 12MP CMOS sensor. It does, however, retain the same F2.0-5.9, 24-120mm lens as the S110 with lens-shift image stabilization. The S200 also features a 3" LCD with 461k dots, manual exposure controls, and built-in Wi-Fi. Keeping with the 'step down' theme from the S110, the S200 only records 720p video and lacks Raw support. The S200 is available in black and white.
