ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: Casio's first foray into wide angle lenses on its ultra compact cameras came in the shape of the EX-Z200 and sister model the EX-Z100 (which is loses the CCD-shift image stabilization but is otherwise identical) - though they have since been joined by several other models in the ever-expanding Exilim Zoom range. The 28-112mm (equiv.) 4x zoom is far more useful than the 3x version used on most of Casio's super slim models, and the ability to shoot widescreen movies in the efficient H.264 format is welcome. Otherwise it's pretty standard stuff, with Casio's usual overabundance of BESTSHOT scene modes (39 in total) and a tiny 10 megapixel sensor. (April 2009)
