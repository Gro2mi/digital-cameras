ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: 'Manufacturer description: Boasting a sensor that is 4.5x larger than a 1/1.7" sensor found in professional level point-and-shoot cameras, the PowerShot G1 X Mark II camera can produce high-quality images with a wide dynamic range. The G1 X II improves upon its predecessor in many ways. It''s smaller, features a faster 24-120mm F2.0-3.9 lens (with closer focusing distances), a 31-point AF system, dual lens rings, a touchscreen LCD that can tilt upward by 180°, and Wi-Fi with NFC. While its 1.5"-type is a bit smaller than on the original, the G1 X II can shoot at 3:2 or 4:3 with the same field-of-view. The catch? No more optical viewfinder (though an EVF is optional).'

    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: "Those desiring a flexible compact camera that's even good for portrait \nphotography."
        NotSoGoodFor: Photographers who demand wide dynamic range. Auto/Program mode shooters. Videographers.
        Conclusion: The PowerShot G1 X Mark II is an enthusiast compact whose fast lens and large sensor allow it to produce impressive photos in both bright and low light. Its well-built body offers three dials, and numerous controls can be customized. That said, there are numerous improvements that could be made, especially in terms of dynamic range and responsiveness.
