ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: Canon's EOS M6 Mark II has a high-resolution 32.5MP sensor, Dual Pixel autofocus and captures 4K/30p video from the full width of its sensor. Despite a comfortable grip the camera remains very compact, with good controls and build quality. If you need an electronic viewfinder, Canon's EVF-DC2 is fully compatible, giving you a bright, contrasty view for both framing and reviewing your images. Currently, Canon's EF-M lens lineup is a bit limiting, but with an adapter, you can use their expansive EF-lens lineup for whatever it is that you'd like to photograph. Rounding out the package is Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity.
