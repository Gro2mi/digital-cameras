ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The Sony SLT A99 is Sony's flagship full frame interchangeable lens camera, and nominally replaces the A900, which was released all the way back in 2008. It uses Sony's 'SLT' design with a 2.3M dot OLED electronic viewfinder, and has a fully-articulated 1.2M dot 3" rear LCD. Its in-body image stabilisation system works with all lenses, new or old.The thoroughly modern A99 features a 24MP 36x24mm CMOS sensor that features on-sensor phase detection, creating a dual AF system that promises improved focus tracking and focus precision. It also includes Sony's Quick Navi interactive status panel and a host of features for video shooters, including a 'silent' control dial, mic and headphone sockets and focus peaking, to make the most of its 1080p60 HD video capability.

    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: Photographers looking for outstanding high ISO performance. DSLR enthusiasts who want the option to shoot using live view without sacrificing AF performance.
        NotSoGoodFor: Dedicated sports shooters and those who prefer an optical viewfinder.
        Conclusion: The SLT-A99 is a feature-rich camera that still provides a wealth of easily accessed manual user controls. It stands out as the only full-frame camera to offer in-body stabilization, an EVF, and an articulated rear screen. Budding videographers will enjoy brisk AF performance, as well as the option to output uncompressed video.
