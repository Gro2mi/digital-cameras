ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The Sony DSC-WX30 is a 5x zoom camera with a 16.2MP backlit CMOS sensor. The lens covers a 25-125mm equivalent zoom and uses the company's 'By Pixel Super Resolution' image processing to provide the 'Clear Image Zoom' feature claimed to double the effective zoom range at full resolution. It also gains the same 'Picture Effect' image filters as the TX55, along with a 3.0" (7.5cm) 920,000 dot, touch-sensitive LCD screen. It uses the CMOS chip's fast read-out to provide 10 fps continuous shooting in a burst of up to 10 shots as well as 1080i50 HD movie shooting on the European variant.
