ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The Samsung Galaxy Camera 3G is a 16MP BSI CMOS compact superzoom/Android smart device hybrid. It combines a 21x, 23-483mm equivalent zoom camera on the front with a 4.8" touchscreen on the back. It runs Android 4.1 (known as Jelly Bean), the latest version of the operating system and has built-in Wi-Fi. Under the surface, the Galaxy Camera shares most of its key specifications with the company's Galaxy SIII smartphone - with a 1.4GHz quad-core processor at its heart, missing only the ability to make calls.
