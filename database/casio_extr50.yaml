ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: 'The Casio Exilim EX-TR50 is the follow-up to the unique "TRYX" camera, which had a hinged body that allowed the camera unit to swivel inside a frame. This allows for interesting ways of composing photos, whether setting the camera on a table or hanging it from a door knob. The TR50 features a 1/1.7" BSI-CMOS sensor (up from 1/2.3" on the original model) and an F2.8, 21mm equivalent lens. Beauty is a big part of the TR50: it has several ''make-up modes'', as well as promotion movies and posing shot features. It can also serve as a mirror. Other features include a 3" 921k touchscreen display, 1080p video, and built-in Wi-Fi. The EX-TR50 will be sold only in certain markets.'
