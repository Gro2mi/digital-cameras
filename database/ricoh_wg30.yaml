ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: 'Manufacturer description: The WG-30 is outfitted with a new state-of-the-art, back illuminated CMOS sensor and 16 effective megapixels. This rugged camera assures brilliant images with low noise, even in dimly lit situations. In keeping with the tradition of the WG line, this new addition is lightweight and compact, yet it is tough enough to perform under a variety of outdoor conditions. The solid, airtight body is not only waterproof to an impressive depth of approximately 40 feet, but also shockproof from a height of 5 feet, crushproof against weights up to 220 pounds, and coldproof to temperatures as frigid as -10 degrees C. This new model includes the WG original Digital Microscope mode allowing the user to capture even the slightest detail, like a pebble in a mountain stream,  while six Macro lights positioned around the lens allow the subject to be more illuminated.Thanks to its Full HD movie recording, the user is able to capture high-quality, extended movie clips at a frame rate of 30 frames per second while its enhanced underwater mode achieves better imagery for those hard to capture underwater shots.'
