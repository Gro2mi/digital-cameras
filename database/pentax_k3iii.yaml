ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The Pentax K-3 Mark III is a mid-sized DSLR with a 25.7MP BSI-CMOS sensor, in-body image stabilization, and an all-new optical viewfinder. The viewfinder offers a large 0.7x (equivalent) magnification and has composition and shooting data on a transparent panel. The camera has a fixed 3.2" touchscreen with 1.62 million dots. The camera has an all-new Safox 13 autofocus system with 101 points, 25 of which being cross-type. The K-3 III can shoot bursts at 12 fps (11 fps with continuous AF). It offers both Pixel Shift Resolution and Anti-aliasing simulator features, with the latter reducing moiré. UHD 4K video can be captured at 30p, with 3-axis image stabilization from the IBIS system.
