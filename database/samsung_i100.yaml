ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: Samsung has been pushing the idea of an all-in-one 'Personal Media Player' (PMP) / camera for several years now, and the i100 is the latest in a line of stylish cameras to offer music (MP3) and movie (MPEG) playback as well as stills and movie capture. The 200MB or so of internal memory is weedy compared to dedicated players and the camera - though packed with gadgetry - is very basic, and the media playback doesn't hide the fact this is a budget camera with a premium price tag. (April 2009).
