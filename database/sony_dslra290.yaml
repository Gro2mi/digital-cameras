ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The DSLR-A290 is the successor to the entry-level A230 and, like its predecessor, only a comparatively minor update. The most substantial change is a new grip design that should allow for more comfortable handling, especially with longer lenses. The other major modification is the image-stabilized 14.2MP CCD sensor that we've previously seen in the A380. As with the previous models the entry-level A290 has a fixed LCD and no liveview but a larger viewfinder than the better specified models that come with live view and a swivel-screen. The 14.2 MP CCD has been around for a while and while image quality at low ISO sensitivity settings is certainly good enough to satisfy the demands of small prints or screen-sized web galleries things fall apart a bit above ISO 800. Images become very blotchy, even in small prints.
