ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: Fujifilm's JV series are intended to appeal to style - as well as budget - conscious photographers. Available in five colors (varying by territory) the metal-bodied JV150 certainly cuts a dash that belies its low pricepoint. As far as specification is concerned, the JV150's 14MP CCD sensor promises slightly higher resolution than you might expect from the JV100, but its 3x optical zoom is the same, and spans an uninspiring 37mm - 111mm range. On the plus side, the JV150 does offer a 720p video mode, as well as the usual rash of scene modes, face detection, blink detection and Scene Recognition Auto.
