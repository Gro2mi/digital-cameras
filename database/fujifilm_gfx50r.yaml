ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The Fujifilm GFX 50R is the the rangefinder version of the company's SLR-styled GFX 50S medium format digital camera. It offers a 43.8 x 32.9mm 51.4MP CMOS sensor and uses new G-mount lenses, with a crop factor of 0.79x. It uses the same X-Processor Pro as the GFX 50S and has an 117-point contrast-detect autofocus system. The body is remarkably compact and lightweight for a medium format camera and it sports a 3.2" tilting touchscreen and an ultra-high-resolution 3.69M-dot OLED electronic viewfinder with a magnification of 0.77x. The top plate has dials for exposure compensation and shutter speed, while 'swipe actions' on the LCD have replaced the four-way controller.The GFX has the usual Fujifilm Film Simulation modes, plus a new Color Chrome Effect option. It's also capable of capturing Full HD video at up to 30p. Unlike the GFX 50S, the 50R has built-in Bluetooth.

    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: Discerning landscape and studio shooters that are on the hunt for the sharpest details they can feast their eyes on.
        NotSoGoodFor: Photographers of dynamic or moving subjects who need good continuous autofocus performance, and those looking to shoot video along with stills.
        Conclusion: The Fujifilm GFX 50R brings medium format digital photography down to a more attainable price point than we've seen before, and does so while offering exceptional image quality in a reasonably compact yet well-built body. The ergonomics suffer a bit from the smaller grip, and some competitors with smaller sensors suffer only a slight image quality hit while being more flexible overall. That said, the GFX 50R remains a joy to use, the images a joy to view, and it's an excellent way to get access to Fujifilm's lineup of GF medium format lenses.
