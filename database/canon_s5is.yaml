ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: Fairly low-key upgrade to the PowerShot S3 IS continues the successful formula of its predecessors, marrying a big 12x zoom lens (36-432mm equiv.) with a solid, 'mini SLR' style body that's packed with features and responsive in use. By no means perfect (the image quality doesn't bear close scrutiny), the S5IS was one of the best superzooms of its time, but has now been superceded by the better, more highly specified (and cheaper) PowerShot SX10 IS.
