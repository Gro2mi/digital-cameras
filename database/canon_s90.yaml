ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The S90 may not look much like the S80, S70 and all its earlier predecessors, but it has been conceived in much the same spirit; a smaller, more stylish alternative to the G series, offering key enthusiast features (such as raw capture and manual controls) in a compact body.  And for the most part the S90 delivers on its promise; the image quality is surprisingly good, the user interface well thought out and the design truly pocket-friendly. The handling takes some getting used to, which I guess is inevitable given how much Canon has tried to cram into a camera the size of an Ixus/Elph. The tiny body might not make for particularly good handling, but it's small enough to carry anywhere and the image quality it produces rarely disappoints.

    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: Lanscapes, interiors and anyone wanting a 'walkaround' compact with excellent image quality
        NotSoGoodFor: Fast moving subjects or low-light social photography. Movies.
        Conclusion: The S90 offers an appealing combination of compact styling, photographic functionality and powerful control. Crucially it also offers some of the best image quality we've seen in such a small camera for a long time, sensor limitations aside. It's got a great lens and great features and is only let down slightly by the inevitable handling issues that come with such a small camera.
