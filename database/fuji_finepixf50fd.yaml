ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The replacement for the near-legendary FinePix F31fd had some big boots to fill, and the FinePix F50fd suffers by comparison to its illustrious predecessor. That said it's a better designed camera offers superb image quality that puts it near the top of the compact camera tree,  and it's fast and has a solid feature set. It's got a lot more competition than its predecessors, but the F50fd is still a camera worth consideration if image quality in all light conditions is a priority. Since replaced by the F60fd.
