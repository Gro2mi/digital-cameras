ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: Canon  introduced the PowerShot A3000 IS and A3100 IS to top its A series of budget compacts at CES 2010. They become the first A series cameras to be built around Lithium Ion rechargeable batteries, rather than AA cells, giving around 230 shots per charge (based on standard tests). Both share the same 35-140mm equivalent (4x) image-stabilized zoom lens and 2.7" LCD screen, with the A3100 offering a 12MP CCD sensor, rather than the A3000's 10MP CCD. In line with their price tags, both cameras feature only VGA movie capability. Both are SDXC compatible.
