ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The Rebel T3i / EOS 600D takes the highly capable T2i / EOS 550D and adds a multi-angle LCD screen, plus a host of beginner-friendly features designed to make it easier for novices to get good results. These include 'Basic +', that offers more user control in the automatic scene modes, a new 'Feature Guide' that gives brief on-screen explanations for camera functions, and an updated fully automatic mode that's now called 'Scene Intelligent Auto'. It also gains the ability to control external flashes wirelessly off-camera, and a very welcome larger, more comfortable handgrip.

    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: Enthusiast shooters looking for some of the latest technology in a well-designed, well-priced package. Movie shooters on a budget.
        NotSoGoodFor: Upgraders looking for a compact-camera-like user experience. Users for whom small size is paramount (who might want to consider a mirrorless alternative)
        Conclusion: 'The latest model in Canon''s popular Rebel series is very much the camera that the range''s history leads us to expect: well featured, well-designed and competitively priced. It''s a very conventional camera in a part of the market that is seeing some interesting innovations, but the conventional DSLR design still best suits many people''s needs, especially when it''s done this convincingly.'
