ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: 'High end ''bridge'' camera that aims to offer the quality and versatility of a digital SLR in a fixed lens camera. The S100FS is an interesting package: one of the largest sensors we''ve seen in a non-DSLR for many years, a lens covering a 14.3x zoom range (that, importantly, starts at a usefully wide-angle 28mm equivalent), and the eighth generation of Fujifilm''s Super CCD sensor technology. There''s some photography-related features that have been added too, such as presets designed to mimic the behavior of specific Fuji films and a dynamic range expansion mode. Image quality, though excellent for a camera of this type, isn''t perfect, but for many users - and uses - it''s not far at all from what you''d get from an entry-level DSLR.'
