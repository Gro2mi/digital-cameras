ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The S10 24-72mm F2.5-4.4 VC is a lens unit that slides into Ricoh's GXR body. The GXR system takes a novel approach by offering interchangeable slide mount 'lens units' - sealed modules containing both optics and sensor, meaning it can switch from a large (APS-C) sensor with a fast prime lens to a tiny one with zoom lenses (such as the S10). The Ricoh GXR/P10 24-72mm combines a 10MP 1/1.7-inch CCD sensor with a 24-72mm equivalent lens. Like the other GXR/lens module combinations the package offers tank-like build quality and an abundance of external controls but with its 1/1.7 10 MP sensor the camera is still a digital compact at heart. It produces image quality that is roughly on par with other cameras featuring similar sensor/lens combinations but comes at a significantly higher price point.

    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: Anyone wanting DSLR-like controls and build quality in a compact package.
        NotSoGoodFor: Pixel-Peepers or low light photographers
        Conclusion: The GXR S10 24-72mm VC comes with the control interface and build quality of a semi-pro DSLR but only produces compact camera image quality. Given its price point, the S10 probably makes most sense as an additional module for existing GXR/A12 users who do not want to familiarize themselves with yet another user interface.
