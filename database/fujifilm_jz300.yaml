ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: Fujifilm's JZ-series offer extremely wide zoom ranges inside compact, stylish bodies. The JZ300 is a close-relation of the JZ500, but features a lower resolution (12MP) CCD sensor. The headline features of the JZ300 include a 10x optical zoom, spanning   28-280mm (equivalent) and 720p HD video, but it also features the same face and pet detection modes that appear in its more expensive cousin, the F80EXR.
