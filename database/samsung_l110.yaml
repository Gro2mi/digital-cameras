ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: One of three almost identical entry-level budget cameras from the prolific Korean giant. Smaller and more stylish than most cameras at this level, the L110 is packed with gadgetry (though inevitably the photographic specification is pretty basic). We tested the L110's 10MP brother (the L210) and found much to like, though the low-light and flash performance was disappointing. The L110 and L100 appear to be functionally identical.
