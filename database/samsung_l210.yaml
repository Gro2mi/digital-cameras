ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The Samsung L210 is one of the few truly compact models in this price bracket, and it packs an impressive list of features including optical image stabilization and a relatively high screen resolution. The polished user interface and quality finish belie the L210's entry-level pricing, and in broad daylight the results aren't bad at all. In low light the performance is far less impressive, with poor high ISO results, less than perfect flash exposures and focus failures. Add to this the long shutter lag (the delay between pressing the button and the picture being taken) and slow startup, and it's obvious that the L210 isn't quite as good as first impressions would suggest.
