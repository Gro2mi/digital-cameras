ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: Small and stylish (something Kodak is finally mastering) 10 megapixel compact that offers 720p30 HD movie capture (MPEG-4), large wide-view 3" screen and a range of color options. The 3x zoom is nothing to write home about but at least it covers a useful 35-105mm range and the overall feature set is pretty comprehensive  for a camera at this price point. One of a range of confusingly similar EasyShare 'M' models that offer minor design and feature variations.
