ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The original 'affordable' full-frame DSLR. The 5D was the first single-grip DSLR to enable the use of EF-mount lenses with the same field-of-view as they offered on film cameras. This 13MP camera, despite a relatively lowly 96% coverage viewfinder, found a home in the hearts and kit-bags of many professional and enthusiast photographers. Technology has moved on a long way and prices have fallen considerably since its launch but the 5D will remain, for many people, the first accessible route to the shallow-depth-of-field and low-light performance that full-frame cameras can bring.
