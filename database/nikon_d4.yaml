ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The Nikon D4, 16MP full-frame professional DSLR is capable of shooting at 11 frames per second (or 10fps with continuous AF). In addition to a host of ergonomic improvements compared to its predecessor the D3S, the D4 also boasts expanded video capabilities, to the extent that Nikon is describing it as a 'multi-media DSLR.' The camera gains an Ethernet port, a 91,000 pixel metering sensor and an uprated AF sensor that can work in lower light and with smaller aperture lenses. Its sensitivity range can be expanded to a maximum equivalent to ISO 204,800 and adds back-lit top and rear controls to make it easier to operate in low-light situations. The D4 also becomes the first camera to make use of the XQD memory card format.
