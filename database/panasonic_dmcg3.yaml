ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The G3 is the smallest interchangeable lens camera to feature an electronic viewfinder. It carries over much of the specification of the very likeable G2 but adds a 15.8MP sensor. It also boasts an accessible interface that combines a balance of hard buttons and touch-screen to make it easier for beginners to get the most out of the camera. The 460k dot rear screen is fully articulated, as well as being touch-sensitive, and can be used to position focus or fire the shutter. The G3 also gains the fast autofocus of the more expensive GH2, making it one of the fastest-focusing cameras in its class.

    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: Users upgrading from a point-and-shoot, low light shooters, photographers who shoot video regularly
        NotSoGoodFor: Anyone that prefers lots of direct control points, or enjoys shooting sports/action
        Conclusion: The G3 is a camera that is easy to use and produces excellent image quality--a step up from previous G-series models. Its overall handling and touchscreen interface have distinct appeal for users moving up from a point-and-shoot. Yet it offers the manual controls and custom parameters that enthusiasts in the market for a smaller, lighter body would expect.
