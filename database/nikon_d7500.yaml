ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The Nikon D7500 is a midrange DSLR that brings updates to the D7200 and also borrows technology from the D500. It features the 20MP CMOS sensor from the D500, making it capable of 4K video at up to 30fps, and expanding its sensitivity to a maximum of ISO 1,640,000. While it keeps the 51-point AF system from the D7200, it gains the 180k-pixel metering sensor from the D500 and enables features like highlight weighted metering. The screen now tilts and also features touch capability. Weather sealing is improved over the D7200 as well, and weight has been reduced to 640 grams.

    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: Sports and action shooters. Anyone looking for a traditional, well-featured DSLR for stills shooting.
        NotSoGoodFor: Videographers. Travel photographers who might be happier with a smaller, lighter body.
        Conclusion: The D7500 is an outstanding stills camera and a refinement of an already excellent DSLR. It brings added speed and buffer depth to the  enthusiast level and adds improved subject recognition. More comfortable to hold than its predecessor, the addition  of a tilting touchscreen only adds to the camera's excellent ergonomics.  And while 4K video is a nice selling point, the 1.5x crop and crummy video AF dim its appeal for movie makers. But for stills shooters, the D7500 is one beast of a camera.
