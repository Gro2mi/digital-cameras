ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The Fujifilm X-T3 is an enthusiast SLR-style mirrorless camera with a new 26MP BSI CMOS X-Trans sensor and updated hybrid AF system with 425 phase-detect points and nearly 100% coverage. The camera has the same analog controls for shutter speed, ISO and exposure compensation as the X-T2 before it, and nine buttons and dials are customizable. The X-T3 has a 3.69M-dot electronic viewfinder with a large 0.75x magnification as well as a touchscreen LCD that tilts on two axes. The tough magnesium-alloy body is sealed against dust and moisture and features twoSD cards that support UHS-II media.The camera shoots continuously at 20 fps (e-shutter) or 11 fps (mechanical shutter) at full resolution, or up to 30 fps in a 1.25x crop mode. Video can be captured at both DCI and UHD 4K at up to 60p, with a top bit rate of 400Mbps. The camera supports the H.265 codec and can output 10-bit video at 4:2:2 over HDMI, or record internal 10-bit at 4:2:0. Both F-Log and HLG are supported.Note that there is an "X-T3 WW" model that does not include a charger but costs $100 less.

    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: A bit of everything, especially if that everything includes video.
        NotSoGoodFor: Sports shooting at the highest levels.
        Conclusion: As a stills camera the X-T3 is a pleasant update to one of our favorite APS-C cameras, significantly improving the autofocus. If you're interested in stills and video, though, it's knockout. The lack of stabilization holds the video back a touch but as a compact, relatively affordable do-everything camera, it's impressive.
