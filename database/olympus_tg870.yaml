    ExecutiveSummary: 'Manufacturer description: The new Stylus Tough TG-870 is a premium rugged camera built to capture high-quality photos and video in the most challenging situations. This compact, take-anywhere camera is packed with features, including a class-leading ultra wide-angle 21mm (equivalent) lens with 5x optical zoom, allowing users the ability to effortlessly frame everything from dramatic landscapes to group shots. Together with its high-resolution 180-degree tilting LCD monitor, customizable front button, Sportcam Modes with full HD 1080/60p video, built-in Wi-Fi and  next-generation GPS.In the tradition of the Olympus Tough series of rugged compact cameras, the Stylus Tough TG-870 is built to withstand extreme conditions: the camera is waterproof to depths of 50 feet (15 m), freezeproof to 14°F (-10°C), shockproof from 7 feet (2.1 m), crushproof to 220 pounds of force (100 kgf) and dustproof. The 21mm–105mm (35mm equivalent) f3.5–5.7 zoom lens is the widest lens in the rugged compact category, perfect for ultra-wide group selfie shots. The Stylus Tough TG-870’s 180-degree tilting 920,000-dot high-resolution LCD monitor has double the resolution and is 1.1x brighter than that of its predecessor, enabling the user to see more detail while shooting outdoors or underwater. The customizable button on the front of the camera can be programmed for several functions, including shutter release, video recording, monitor boost, LED assist and Super Macro Mode.An impressive variety of shooting modes and 13 Art Filters, including 6 new filters (Vintage, Key Line, Watercolor, Light Tone, Cross Process and Gentle Sepia), help the user capture distinctive images. The Stylus Tough TG-870 is equipped with nighttime Live Composite Mode, which automatically combines the brightest areas of multiple images taken with interval shooting for dramatic photos of cityscapes, star trails and light painting. Sportcam Mode puts four video options right at the user’s fingertips. With 60p Movie, the camera captures full HD 1080p video at 60 frames per second (fps), with 720/60p and 480/60p options also available. With High-Speed Movie, the Stylus Tough TG-870 can record slow-motion video at 120 fps at 854x480 (16:9) or 640x480 (4:3) resolution, or 240 fps at 640x360 (16:9) or 480x360 (4:3) resolution. Time Lapse Movie compresses hours of action into a short movie, and Sport Burst allows photographers to capture sequential images with a shutter interval of 0.05 to 60 seconds.'
