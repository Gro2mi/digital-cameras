ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The Canon EOS-1D X Mark III is a professional digital SLR with a newly designed 20MP full-frame CMOS sensor and Digic X processor. It has an all-new 191-point AF system that uses 'deep learning' to track heads and faces. In live view, it uses Dual Pixel AF to quickly focus and track subjects for stills and video. It can shoot at 20 fps in live view and 16 fps with the viewfinder with continuous exposure and focus, with a buffer that can hold over 1000 photos. The Mark III can capture 5.5K/60p Raw video as well as UHD and DCI 4K at up to 60p (though AF is locked at that frame rate - a cropped DCI 4K/60p mode offers AF). When using Canon Log it can record 10-bit, 4:2:2 video internally. As one would expect, a mic and headphone socket are included.The body is as rugged as they come and is fully weather-sealed. It has a unique AF-point joystick that uses an optical sensor to track finger movements, and many buttons on the rear are backlit. The large optical viewfinder has a magnification of 0.76x and an eye point of 20mm. Photos can also be composed on a 3.2" touchscreen LCD with over 2.1 million dots. The Mark III has a pair of CFexpress slots plus built-in Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and GPS. An optional wireless transmitter allows for faster speeds and additional features.

    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: Sports and action photography professionals, wedding, event and hybrid stills / video shooters, photojournalists.
        NotSoGoodFor: Dedicated landscape photographers, action, travel and adventure photographers looking for a lighter solution.
        Conclusion: Canon's EOS-1D X Mark III is currently the camera to beat in its class. It churns out great images right out of the camera, has class-leading dynamic range and makes for a powerful video camera. Its autofocus subject tracking is, if not head-and-shoulders above its peers, competitive with the best on the market. If you need a rugged camera that can keep up with just about anything you point it at, then look no further.
