ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The 12MP a7S II is Sony's flagship 'hybrid' stills and video mirrorless interchangeable lens camera. Offering ultra-high sensitivity and wide dynamic range across the entire ISO range plus 5-axis image stabilization for greater shooting control, the a7S II is ideally suited to capturing stills and video in challenging lighting conditions. Full-frame 4K video can be recorded internally with full pixel readout and no pixel binning, and full HD video can be captured at 120fps at 100Mbps. The a7S II delivers an ISO sensitivity range of ISO 50-4096001 for both stills and video capture.
