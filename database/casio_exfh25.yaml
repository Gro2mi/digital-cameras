    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: High speed video and continuous shooting
        NotSoGoodFor: Manual setting of parameters and low light shooting
        Conclusion: The Casio is a good choice if  you are specifically looking for a camera with high speed capture capabilities. Its 'core' photographic performance is by no means horrible but the camera struggles more than some rivals in low light and the user interface is most suitable for snap shot type shooting.
