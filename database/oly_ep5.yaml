ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: 'The Olympus PEN-EP5 is the fourth model in the E-P range, and arguably the most desirable PEN yet. It includes many of the features that made the E-M5 such a compelling package, such as the same 16MP MOS sensor, advanced ''5-axis'' in-body image stabilization (now with automatic panning detection), 9 fps continuous shooting, and tilting rear touch screen. It also inherits the refinements debuted on the PEN E-PL5, such as enhanced in-camera RAW conversion, a broad-range ''HDR bracketing'' mode, and the ability to specify whether you wish to use in-lens or in-body image stabilization with Panasonic OIS lenses. On top of this it adds this year''s must-have feature: built in Wi-Fi for connection to your smartphone or tablet.'

    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: Out-and-about shooting. Making the most of Olympus's range of prime lenses.
        NotSoGoodFor: Sports shooting or videography.
        Conclusion: The E-P5 is the most substantial reworking of the original PEN model, and it's the most impressive yet. It produces the same excellent image quality as the E-M5 and has a proper two-dial control system. This, combined with a better touch screen and arguably the prettiest PEN body, make it a more attractive and more complete camera than the series has seen before.
