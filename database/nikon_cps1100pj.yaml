ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: A year after the debut of the Coolpix S1000pj, the world's first compact with a built-projector, Nikon introduced its successor - the S1100pj. Built around the same stabilized 28-140mm equivalent lens as the S1000pj, it comes with a 14.1Mp sensor and larger, higher resolution 460K dot 3.0" LCD.The body design has also been slightly modified and the projector improved to offer great brightness, image size and throw distance.
