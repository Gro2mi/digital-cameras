ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The Olympus Pen E-PM2 is an entry-level Micro Four Thirds system camera, built around an excellent 16MP CMOS sensor (the same one that Olympus uses in its flagship OM-D) with full 1080 HD video. It's one of the smallest mirrorless cameras on the market and boasts 8 frames per second continuous shooting. This second generation "Mini" gains a customizable function button and a grip for a solid feel in the hand. A fixed 3.0 inch LCD is touch-friendly, enabling useful features like touch focus and touch shutter.Manual exposure modes are available for more hands-on users, and activating the optional Super Control Panel provides quick access to key shooting parameters without diving deep into the camera's menu system.

    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: Everyday 'auto everything' photography where speed, responsiveness and great JPEGs are what you need.
        NotSoGoodFor: More involved, critical work where the lack of external controls can make more 'hands-on' operation a little difficult.
        Conclusion: The Olympus PEN-EPM2 is a point-and-shoot mirrorless camera which does exactly what a novice will need it to. For more adventurous users, there's a lot of functionality hidden beneath the skin (including the image quality of the OM-D) making the E-PM2 a potentially very attractive second camera.
