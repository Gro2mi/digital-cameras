ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The Panasonic Lumix DMC-GX85 is the 'little brother' to the enthusiast-grade GX8, offering the majority of the same features but with a fixed EVF and lower resolution Live MOS sensor. Some of the inherited features include Dual IS, which combines in-body 5-axis and in-lens image stabilization, the company's impressive Depth from Defocus AF system, 4K photo and Post Focus and, of course 4K video capture. New to the GX85 are a 16:9 fixed electronic viewfinder with 2.75 million dots (equivalent) and a tilting 3" touchscreen display. The GX85 also supports Wi-Fi and battery charging over USB.
