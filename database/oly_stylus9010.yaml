ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The most striking thing about the µ-9010 is its weight - or rather its   lack thereof. Olympus has managed to pack a lot into its 170g though (even if we're not quite sure how or where) including a 10x optical zoom, and a range of features designed to appeal to photo enthusiasts, like quick panorama, in-camera retouching, and 720p HD video. Olympus should be commended for fitting so much functionality into such a small form factor, but the downside is that the µ-9010 lacks the reassuring rigidity of a camera like the Panasonic DMC-ZS7. Image quality is in the low side of adequate, but the main selling point of the µ-9010 is, of course, its small size and low weight. The mere fact that Olympus has managed to pack a 10x zoom lens into a body that weighs 173g (including battery and card) will appeal to a lot of potential buyers.

    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: Anyone looking for a fast and simple compact that is happy to let the camera do the thinking
        NotSoGoodFor: More advanced users, and anyone with big hands.
        Conclusion: The Olympus Stylus 9010 is the easiest of all of these cameras to tote around all day, and as such it makes an excellent travel companion. Sadly, its tiny plastic controls and sub-par image quality (especially in video mode) let it down. But if you like small, simple and fast, the Stylus 9010 is an excellent choice.
