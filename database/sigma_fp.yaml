ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The Sigma fp is, as of July 2019, the world's smallest full-frame mirrorless digital camera. This L-mount camera features a 24.6 BSI-CMOS sensor with a traditional Bayer color filter, a contrast-detect AF system and fully electronic shutter. It can shoot bursts as fast as 18 fps and offers an Auto HDR mode for both stills and videos. The camera can record 12-bit Cinema DNG video to an external recorder, as well as UHD 4K internally. The camera is designed to be modular, with optional grips, flash brackets, an 'LCD viewfinder' and more. Sigma has opened up the system so third party manufacturers can get in on the action.
