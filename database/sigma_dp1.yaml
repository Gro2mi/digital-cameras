ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The DP1 uses the same Foveon X3 sensor as Sigma's SD14 DSLR and that makes it the first compact camera ever to be made with an SLR-sized sensor (it's around the same size as the Four-Thirds format). But it's not only the sensor that differentiates the new Sigma from the scores of compact cameras on the market today. With its no-nonsense feature set and 28mm (35mm equiv.) prime lens the DP1 is a million miles away from the superzooms, smile modes and face detection functions that are nowadays standard on so many compact digital cameras. Image quality is amazing for a compact, and if you can live with the slow performance, limited feature set and idiosynchratic operation it's the nearest thing yet to a pocketable SLR alternative.
