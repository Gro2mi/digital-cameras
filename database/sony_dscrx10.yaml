ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The Sony Cyber-shot DSC-RX10 is an ultra zoom compact camera, featuring a 24-200mm equivalent (8.3x optical zoom) lens with a continuous F2.8 maximum aperture, and a 1-inch, 20 megapixel BSI-CMOS sensor. The RX10 uses the new Bionz X sensor (the same as the Alpha 7R/7 full-frame mirrorless cameras), which provides improved sharpness and noise reduction, reduced diffraction, and snappy performance.Other features include a 3-inch tilting WhiteMagic LCD with 1.228 million dots, SVGA electronic viewfinder, a weather-resistent body, Wi-Fi, 1080/60p video with uncompressed HDMI output, and much more.

    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: Video and stills enthusiasts; travelers who want DSLR/mirrorless quality without having to carry one around
        NotSoGoodFor: Budget-conscious buyers; those expecting more zoom power or who want the flexibility of interchangeable lenses
        Conclusion: The Cyber-shot DSC-RX10 offers a great combination of still and video quality, thanks to its one-inch sensor and 24-200 F2.8 lens. Its focus is as much about video as stills, and the RX10 offers more controls in that respect than virtually any other camera. Its hefty price may put it out of reach for many enthusiasts, though.
