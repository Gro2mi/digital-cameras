ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: Fujifilm's JX-series is intended to provide a step up from the JVs, but the differences are fairly subtle. The FinePix JX350 is dinstinguished from the JX300 by its 16MP sensor, but in all other respects it is the same. The JX350 has a 5x zoom lens, which covers a useful 28-140mm (equivalent) range, and it can capture 720p video footage. The JX350 comes with the standard Fujifilm feature suite which includes face detection, blink detection and Scene Recognition auto, and also offers inbuilt Facebook and YouTube image editing and selection functionality, making it easier to post images and movie clips online.
