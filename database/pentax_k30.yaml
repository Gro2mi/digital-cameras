    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: Stills photographers who want a weather-sealed camera with good customizability and great low light performance without breaking the bank
        NotSoGoodFor: Video shooters
        Conclusion: The Pentax K-30 offers a comprehensive feature set, excellent high-ISO performance, and very flexible raw files at an attractive price point, and is therefore an easy recommendation for any stills photographer. However, if you are looking for a DSLR to shoot video with, the competition offers better alternatives.
