ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The GoPro Hero 7 White is a budget-friendly action cam that launched alongside the higher-spec'd Black and Silver editions. The Hero 7 White offers a more pared-down feature set including 1080/60p video recording, Wi-Fi + Bluetooth and 10MP stills. It uses a built-in rather than removable lithium-ion battery, and lacks the built-in GPS offered by the Black and Silver Hero 7s.
