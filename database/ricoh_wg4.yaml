ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: 'Manufacturer description: Continuing the rugged heritage of the WG series of cameras, the Ricoh WG-4 is waterproof to 45 feet, shockproof from drops of up to 6.6 feet, cold proof to 14 degrees Fahrenheit and crushproof, withstanding up to 220 foot-pounds of force. In addition, the Ricoh WG-4 features a 16-megapixel CMOS sensor and a thoughtfully designed folded optical 4X zoom lens, enabling its pocketability while also ensuring its optics are not exposed dust and moisture like those of a protruding lens barrel. Finally, the adventure-prone explorer need not worry about blurry images. Thanks to the WG-4’s fast F2.0 maximum aperture and dual shake reduction system, which combines an image-sensor-shift-type SR (Shake Reduction) mechanism with a Digital SR mode, to guarantee clear, sharp images even in shake-prone conditions.'

    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: Those seeking a rugged camera where underwater photos aren't the highest priority.
        NotSoGoodFor: Serious underwater shooters, connected photographers, and those who need the battery to last a full day.
        Conclusion: Adventurous photographers who want a camera that can survive the elements AND be stepped on will like what the WG-4 has to offer. Image quality is among the best in the rugged camera class and there are a plethora of features available, including a shutter priority mode. The WG-4 is marred by mediocre underwater photo quality, lousy battery life, and the lack of Wi-Fi.
