ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The Panasonic Lumix DC-TS7 (known as the FT7 outside of North America) is the first compact rugged camera to feature an electronic viewfinder (as of May 2018). The camera is waterproof to 31m/102ft, shockproof to 2m/6.6ft, pressure resistant to 100kgf/220lbf and freezeproof to 10°C/-14°F.It pairs a 20.4MP BSI-CMOS with a optically stabilized 28-128mm equivalent F3.3-5.9 lens. The main attraction is a 0.2" electronic viewfinder with 1.17M-dot equivalent viewfinder for shooting outdoors. There's also a 3" LCD display with 1.04 milliion dots. The camera can record 4K video at 24p or 30p and has a high speed 120 fps mode, albeit at 1280 x 720. Wi-Fi is built in, though the TS7 doesn't offer Bluetooth like many other modern Panasonic cameras. Battery life in rated at a respectable 300 shots per charge.
