ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The Panasonic Lumix DMC-GF2 is a simplified version of the company's GF1, it inherits the same flat-body design but with revised control layout and touch-screen control. It is built around a 12MP CMOS sensor but with a more powerful processor than its predecessor, allowing AVCHD video recording of 1080i60 movies from 1080p30 capture. It is also compatible with the company's recently released 3D lens.

    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: Upgraders from compact cameras looking for higher image quality and easy creative control
        NotSoGoodFor: Users looking for excellent images straight out of the camera without having to use raw
        Conclusion: The GF2 sees Panasonic packing a lot of approachable creative control into a compact package, with one of the best-implemented touchscreens we've ever seen on a camera. It's fast and responsive with excellent raw image quality, but the JPEG output is disappointing.
