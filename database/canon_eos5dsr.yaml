ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: 'The Canon EOS 5DS R features an all-new 50.6 megapixel CMOS sensor, along with dual DIGIC 6 processors. The ''R'' model cancels out the anti-aliasing filter for maximum resolution (at the expense of moiré). The autofocus system has a total of 61 points (in a ''high density reticular array''), 41 of which are cross-type. It uses the same 150,000 pixel RGB+IR metering system as the EOS 7D II with a scene detection system. The metering system also has an anti-flicker function for shooting under sodium vapor lights. The ISO range on the camera is 100-6400, expandable to 12800.The 5DS R has a more rigid chassis than the EOS 5D III in order to minimize camera shake and improve rigidity. The shutter is rated to 150,000 cycles. The 5DS sports an ''Intelligent Viewfinder II'' which has an embedded transparent LCD panel that can display cropped shooting frames, composition grids, and an electronic level. It also sports a 3.2" LCD display with 1.04M dots and dual memory card slots (CompactFlash and SD/SDHC/SDXC with UHS-I support).Photographers have a choice of two crop modes: 1.3x (30.5MP) aqnd 1.6x (19.6MP) as well as medium and small-size Raws. The 5DS can shoot continuously at 5 fps. Video-wise, the 5DS supports 1080/30p recording , though it lacks clean HDMI output and a headphone jack.'

    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: Studio photographers, landscape work, fashion photography
        NotSoGoodFor: Videographers, Candid portrait shooters
        Conclusion: 'The Canon EOS 5DS R is the company''s highest-resolution camera, building a 50MP sensor into a body that will be immediately familiar to existing 5D series users. The camera''s autofocus has been upgraded though it still lags behind the best of its competitors for close-up work. Its video features and quality are also a touch disappointing, as its rivals begin to take video more seriously. That said, the camera excels in a number of respects: resolution is outstanding and the camera does much to ensure the images are kept steady and its JPEG engine provides the colors that countless professionals are happy to depend upon.'
