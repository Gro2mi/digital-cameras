ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: Leica's M10-P is the more expensive sibling to the M10. The differences between the M10-P and M10 include the lack of a 'red dot' on the front as well as the addition of a touchscreen LCD, electronic level and quieter shutter mechanism. The M10 comes with a 24MP sensor with a top ISO of 50000. The Maestro II processor has 2GB of buffer to provide 30 Raw images or 100 JPEG images to be captured at 5 fps. The M10-P has some degree of environmental sealing and lacks any I/O ports. It does have Wi-Fi support, however.
