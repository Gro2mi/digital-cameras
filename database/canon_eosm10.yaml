ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The Canon EOS M10 is offered with a collapsible 15-45mm F3.5-6.3 IS kit lens, taking up residence below the more advanced EOS M3 in that company's mirrorless lineup. A replacement for the Canon EOS M2, the M10 offers an 18MP APS-C CMOS sensor, 3" 1.04M dot tilting touch screen LCD, built-in Wi-Fi with NFC and 1080/30p video recording. The M10 provides a built-in flash, but no viewfinder or hot shoe for an accessory unit. Its Hybrid CMOS II AF system gets an upgrade over the M2, jumping from 31 to 49 points. Its ISO range extends from 125 to a 25600 expansion.
