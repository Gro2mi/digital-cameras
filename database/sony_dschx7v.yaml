ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The GPS and compass enabled DSC-HX7V features Sony's newly-developed 16.1MP back-illuminated Exmor-R CMOS sensor that allows recording of full 1080i60 HD videos, 10 fps full resolution continuous shooting and can generate 3D images. Its HD output allows you to playback images and videos directly on televisions and computers via an HDMI cable. The camera also comes with a Background Defocus modes that tries to blur background, aiming to replicate shallower depth of fields of wider apertures in DSLRs. Its HDR feature compiles the highlights, mid-tones and shadows from three separate shots to create a single image with a wide dynamic range
