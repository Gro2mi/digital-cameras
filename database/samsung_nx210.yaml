ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: 'Manufacturer description: Customized for the NX System, the brand-new, professional-grade, 20.3MP APS-C CMOS Sensor produces images that rival those of any premium DSLR. Each individual pixel has a large sensor area and receives more light, guaranteeing low noise levels, high dynamic range and accurate color differentiation. The higher sensitivity allows you to shoot during low-light situations without graininess or other noise. The new sensor also provides Full HD video output capabilities.'

    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: Photographers who want to capture a lot of low ISO detail in a compact package, anyone who wants to share/transfer images on the go
        NotSoGoodFor: High-ISO photography in JPEG mode, action photography
        Conclusion: The Samsung NX210 offers you the high pixel count and compact dimensions of the NX200 and adds Wi-Fi connectivity to the mix. The NX210 is slightly let down by long buffering times in raw mode and the JPEG engine's noise treatment at high sensitivities, but overall it is a powerful photographic tool with a good feature set for its class and enjoyable to use.
