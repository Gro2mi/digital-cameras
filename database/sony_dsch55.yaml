ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The Cybershot DSC-H55 offers a few cool features that help to set it apart from the competition, amongst them Sony's 'Sweep Panorama' and DRO (dynamic range optimisation) modes. In terms of critical image quality, the H55 delivers a lot of detail, and reasonable definition when viewed at 100%. Like all of the 14Mp cameras in its segment of the market, however, diffraction means that you shouldn't expect to get significantly 'better' images than you might expect from a 10Mp or 12Mp sensor - just slightly bigger files. The most nagging frustration that we have with the H55 is its operational speed, which in some respects verges on the soporific. Overall, the H55 does exactly what it is designed to do. However, there are better cameras on the market both, in terms of critical image   quality, versatility, and value for money.

    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: On-the-go photographers looking for point-and-shoot simplicity.
        NotSoGoodFor: Speed, and anything requiring advanced manual control
        Conclusion: The Sony Cyber-Shot H55 is a very capable point-and shoot camera which packs an impressive feature set. As long as you don't want to take a lot of control over your photography the H55 will serve you well, but slow operation, slightly sketchy image quality and a lack of customization mean that the Sony doesn't score as well as other cameras in this group.
