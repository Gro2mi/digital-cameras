ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: Fujifilm's budget 'A' series cameras have got a lot more stylish - and a lot slimmer - in recent years, but the basic feature set remains just that; basic. The 10 megapixel A150 (and slightly lower spec sibling the A100) offers a simple entry point to digital photography at a suitably low price, but the modest 3x zoom and  point-and-shoot functionality struggle to stand out from the crowd, despite the slender (for a budget camera) dimensions. If you want a small, relatively stylish camera and are on a very tight budget the A100 is probably a better bet.
