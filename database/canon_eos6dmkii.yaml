ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The 6D Mark II is Canon's 'entry-level' full-frame digital SLR. It uses an all-new 26.2MP CMOS sensor and Canon's DIGIC 7 processor. It features Dual Pixel AF which allows for very responsive autofocus when shooting live view or video. When using the optical viewfinder you'll have a 45-point all-cross-type AF system at your disposal. The camera can shoot at up to 6.5 fps with Servo AF and has a top ISO of 40,000. The 6D II has a 3" fully articulating touchscreen LCD and a weather and dust-resistant body. It captures 1080/60p video and can create 4K time-lapse movies. It also has Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and NFC support for easy camera control and photo-sharing.

    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: Social and general use, easy capture of casual video clips and those looking for a backup body for Canon full-frame glass.
        NotSoGoodFor: Photographers needing the best image quality for landscape work, or sports and action photographers needing a more capable autofocus system.
        Conclusion: As it should be, the EOS 6D II is a better camera than its predecessor in almost every way. With plenty of resolution, respectable burst shooting speeds and pleasing Canon color, it's a camera that's capable of producing great images in a variety of situations. Despite this, it is simply overshadowed by competition that is made up of more capable cameras at similar or lower prices.
