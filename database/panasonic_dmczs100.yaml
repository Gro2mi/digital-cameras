ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The Panasonic Lumix DMC-ZS100 (known as the TZ100 in most regions outside of North America) is a compact travel zoom featuring a 20 megapixel, 1"-type sensor. It's paired with a 25-250mm equivalent F2.8-5.9 Leica DC lens which incorporates the company's snappy Depth from Defocus autofocus technology. It offers a 3" touchscreen LCD as well as a 1.04M-dot electronic viewfinder, Raw support, 10 fps continuous shooting (5 fps with AF) and Wi-Fi. On the video side it can record 4K/UHD video at 30p and 24p as well as  1080/60p clips. The camera's unique 4K photo mode lets you grab high quality 8MP stills from 4K videos with ease.

    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: Travelers who want great photo and 4K video quality for subjects near and far.
        NotSoGoodFor: Photographers who use electronic viewfinders most of the time.
        Conclusion: The Panasonic Lumix DMC-ZS100/TZ100 is an enthusiast travel zoom with a 1"-type BSI CMOS sensor and a 25-250mm equivalent lens. The camera has very good photo and 4K video quality, a great autofocus system, and a plethora of genuinely useful 'extras', such as Post Focus. The main weakness of the camera is its mediocre electronic viewfinder, but it's still better than not having one at all. Overall, though, the ZS100 is a top-notch travel zoom that's not to be missed.
