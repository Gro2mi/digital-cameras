ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The Leica M9-P is a variant of the 18MP full-frame M9 rangefinder camera. The P version gains the sapphire crystal LCD glass previously seen on the Leica M8.2 but featuring an improved anti-reflective coatings for improved visibility in difficult lighting conditions. In order to give an understated appearance, the M9-P omits the traditional Leica red dot and M9 designation from the front of the camera, instead the Leica name is engaved in the metal top-plate in the company's traditional script.
