ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: In amongst all the cameras announced at Photokina 2010 - including enthusiast SLRs such as the Nikon D7000, Canon EOS 60D, Pentax K-5 and Sigma SD1 - one utterly unexpected model stole the show. Fujifilm unveiled the FinePix X100, a compact camera with an SLR-size APS-C sensor and traditional analogue control dials, that hides ground-breaking technology inside a retro-styled body with looks to die for. The X100 uses traditional analogue-style control dials for shutter speed, aperture and exposure compensation, alongside an electronically coupled (‘focus-by-wire’) manual focus ring. But the biggest story is its innovative hybrid viewfinder, which combines a conventional direct-vision optical viewfinder with a high-resolution electronic viewfinder. This, in principle at least, gives the best of both worlds, plus a few unique tricks of its own. If you prefer, you can of course also frame your shots using the 2.7"" rear LCD, like any other compact camera.

    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: Enthusiast and professional photographers looking for excellent image quality and traditional analogue controls in a relatively small, discreet package
        NotSoGoodFor: Photographers demanding fast, flawless operation, especially in low light.
        Conclusion: The X100 combines excellent image quality, solid build and a superb viewfinder with somewhat sluggish and quirky operation. It's been much improved by multiple firmware updates since its initial incarnation, and despite its flaws, is now a very likeable camera indeed.
