ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The Panasonic Lumix DMC-GH2 is the successor to the GH1. The GH2 continues with its 'hybrid' stills/video philosophy but adds a host of tweaks and improvements, foremost of which is a brand new 18Mp multi-aspect ratio sensor offering 16Mp output and an ISO range of 160-12800. The GH2 also inherits many features from the DMC-G2, including a revised control layout and touch-screen control.

    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: High quality still (in RAW mode) and movie capture.
        NotSoGoodFor: Fans of fast action, and anyone that needs print-ready JPEGs straight out of the camera.
        Conclusion: The GH2 is the best G-series camera to date, and the improvements that Panasonic has made compared to the GH1 and G2, especially regarding AF performance and movie shooting, are meaningful and very welcome. We love the combination of physical control points and touchscreen operation, and ultimately, only murky JPEG output in low-contrast environments lets the GH2 down.
