ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: Mid-sized  12 megapixel compact with a 5x zoom that's marginally cheaper than sister model the Z1085is, but the pointless extra megapixels are no compensation for the loss of optical image stabilization and reduced manual controls. Decent enough feature set but there are more appealing models in Kodak's range - and elsewhere.
