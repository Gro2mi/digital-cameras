ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: Like sister model the L20, the Coolpix L19 is a basic budget camera with bare bones point-and-shoot functionality in an understated body. You do get a 3.6x zoom lens (covering a less than ideal 41-145mm range - so no wideangle) and a handful of new gadgets designed to provide true point-and-shoot ease of use (including Auto Scene Selector, Smile Mode and Blink Detection) and a 2.7" screen, but that's about it.
