ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: Launched as the world's smallest 12x zoom camera, the FinePix S1000fd is one of a long line of very compact SLR-styled big zoom cameras designed to appeal to those wanting a lot of lens on a tight budget. The lack of optical image stabilization limits the usefulness of the longer end of the zoom in anything but bright daylight, but for the money you're getting a lot of features - including full photographic controls and a 2cm macro mode - in a lightweight package.
