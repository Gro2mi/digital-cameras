ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The Nikon Coolpix P330 is Nikon's latest small form-factor enthusiast compact camera. It features PASM exposure modes, raw capture and a larger, (1/1.7in) lower-resolution sensor (almost certainly the same 12MP one found in the Coolpix P7700), without sacrificing what was good about its predecessors - a compact body, relatively fast lens, good build quality, and a useful zoom range. As such it represents Nikon's most serious attempt to offer a real competitor to the Canon PowerShot S110 and its popular predecessors the S100 and S95.
