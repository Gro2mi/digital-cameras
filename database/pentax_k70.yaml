ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The Pentax K-70 is a midrange DSLR, priced at the same level as many competitive entry-level models. It sports a 24MP CMOS sensor with on-sensor phase detection, a first for a Pentax DSLR. The camera can use its sensor-shift IS system for a 'Pixel Shift' mode, which reduces color noise and enhances resolution. The IS system can also be used to simulate an anti-aliasing system, so users can choose whether they want maximum resolution or less moiré. The K-70 has a weather-sealed body with a large optical viewfinder as well a 3" fully articulating LCD with a 'night vision' function for astrophotography. The camera can capture video at 1080/30p and also has built-in Wi-Fi.

    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: Landscape photographers, available light shooters, current Pentax owners looking for an affordable second body
        NotSoGoodFor: Photographers looking to pack light, video shooters, action shooters
        Conclusion: While not as refined as the competition, the K-70 doesn't feel crude or cheap as its predecessors. In fact, it offers the most controls and features of the competition, at a considerably lower price. For the cash-strapped enthusiast that wants complete control, there is no better value for money in the segment, and there are few flaws to make the buyer feel like they 'cheaped out'.
