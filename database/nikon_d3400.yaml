ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The Nikon D3400 is the company's entry-level DSLR camera. It's a modest update to the D3300, using the same 24MP APS-C CMOS sensor, EXPEED 4 image processor, Full HD video capture and an easy-to-use interface. The camera has an ISO range of 100-25600, an 11-point autofocus system and can shoot continuously at 5 fps. The camera's Guide Mode makes it easy to learn how to shoot in various situations. While it doesn't have Wi-Fi, the D3400 has Bluetooth connectivity for transferring images from the camera to a smartphone, albeit slowly.

    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: A beginner specifically looking for a DSLR experience who may want to eventually take a little control over shooting settings or someone looking for a lightweight kit.
        NotSoGoodFor: DSLR users looking to regularly take control over more camera settings and those looking for lots of easily accessible, reliable in-camera effects modes and features. Users who need more reliable AF with additional coverage for capturing moving subjects such as small children.
        Conclusion: "Although the D3400 only received a modest update it still hold its own as one of the better beginner DSLRs on the market. The camera still features a 24MP APS-C CMOS sensor that offers fantastic Raw performance and punchy, yet pleasing JPEGs. The kit lenses have seen an upgrade to their focus motors which makes for much faster focusing times in Live-View and during video capture. The AF system is reliable, but it's very sparse in coverage and has difficulty tracking subjects like small children. \n\nMore advanced shooters will be disappointed by the control layout, which still doesn't allow for much growth as a photographer. The camera also lacks a touch or articulating screen that would make better use of the D3400's features. That being said the D3400 still performs very well and produces quality photos."
