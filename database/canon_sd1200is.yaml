ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: Replacement for the SD1100 IS, the SD 1200 IS (Ixus 95) is yet another slimline, metal-bodied pocket camera with a 3x zoom and 2.5" LCD screen and a choice of colors. As with all Ixus/Elph models the emphasis is on style and ease of use, and specification is fairly high (Smart Auto mode, optical image stabilizer, DIGIC 4 processor), but this is a pretty, ultra compact point and shoot camera, nothing more, nothing less.
