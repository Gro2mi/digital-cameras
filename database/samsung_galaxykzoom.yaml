ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The Samsung Galaxy K Zoom is the successor to the Galaxy S4 Zoom. It offers a slimmer body than its predecessor and all around upgraded specs. The Super AMOLED screen has grown from 4.3 to 4.8 inches which brings it close to the 5-inch displays of many current top-end smartphones but the resolution remains at 720p.Android 4.4 is powered by an Exynos 5 Hexa SoC with six CPU cores and 2GB RAM. There are only 8GB of internal memory but it can be expanded, thanks to a microSD slot. LTE, Bluetooth 4.0, Wi-Fi and NFC are all on board and power is provided by a 2,430 mAh battery.On the camera module, the most obvious change is the increased pixel count. The 1/2.3-inch BSI CMOS sensor now captures 20.7MP images versus the S4 Zoom's 16MP. The 10x zoom lens offers the same 24-240mm equivalent focal range and F3.1-6.3 maximum aperture as the S4 Zoom and comes with optical image stabilization. There is also a xenon flash and a 2MP front camera for the occasional selfie.
