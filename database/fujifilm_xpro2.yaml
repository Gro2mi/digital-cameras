ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: 'Manufacturer description: The Fujifilm X-Pro2 is the long-awaited update to the X-Pro1 and offers a new 24.3MP APS-C X-Trans CMOS III sensor and an ''advanced hybrid multi viewfinder'' that can be an optical or electronic viewfinder, or a combination of the two. Its new image processor is 4x faster than that of its predecessor and offers a top ISO of 51,200. The autofocus system has been updated substantially, now offering 273 total AF points, of which 77 are phase detection (covering 40% of the frame), and much faster performance.The X-Pro2''s body is made from four pieces of magnesium alloy with 61 seals, making it splash and dust proof, and functional down to temperatures of +14F. It has dedicated dials for exposure compensation, shutter speed and ISO. It has a maximum shutter speed of 1/8000 sec and an x-sync speed of 1/250 sec. Other features of note include a 3", 1.62M-dot LCD, twin SD card slots, interval shooting and a new ACROS film simulation mode. The X-Pro2 can record 1080/60p video at 36MBps and offers a 2.5mm mic input jack. As one would expect, the camera also supports Wi-Fi with remote camera control.'

    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: Photographers looking for an involved, traditional shooting experience. Anyone who wants a camera with a little style and character.
        NotSoGoodFor: Sports shooters, dedicated videographers or anyone expecting a DSLR-like shooting experience.
        Conclusion: The X-Pro2 is a 24MP high-end X-mount camera whose appeal is inextricably linked to its innovative optical/electronic hybrid viewfinder. It offers excellent image quality and some of the best out-of-camera JPEGs on the market, and comes in a well built, elegant body with plenty of direct control. Video is good but not cutting-edge either in terms of quality or supporting features. When it comes to still image quality the X-Pro2 can deliver. Whether or not this is the camera for you depends on whether you find its styling (and predisposition towards prime-lens shooting) appealing, or unnecessarily idiosyncratic.
