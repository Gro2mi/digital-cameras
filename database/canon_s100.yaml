ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: 'The Canon PowerShot S100 features a broader, 5x lens range (24-120mm equiv.), the company''s latest image stabilization and built-in GPS. The interesting specification, from our perspective, is the homegrown 12MP CMOS sensor. The Canon S100 is particularly well-suited to two types of photographers: compact camera shooters looking to upgrade to a similarly small camera with more control, raw mode and better image quality, and ILC photographers looking for a truly compact ''take anywhere'' pocket camera with much of the same manual control as their larger cameras. The addition of GPS and full HD video recording make the S100 feel more complete than the S95, which was a very capable camera but in some respects lagged slightly behind on its feature set when compared to the competition. The additional lens range, too, is very welcome, and makes the S100 just that little bit more versatile than its predecessors.'

    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: Someone looking for a good amount of manual control and raw shooting capability in a small, fast pocket camera.
        NotSoGoodFor: Anything that requires a greater telephoto reach such as sports or wildlife.
        Conclusion: For photographers who like to take control over their cameras the S100 provides a near DSLR-like level of manual control in an easily pocketable 'take-anywhere' camera.
