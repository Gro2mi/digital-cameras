ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The GoPro Max is a 360-degree camera and successor to the Fusion. The Max captures 16MP still images and – thanks to lenses on either side of the camera – can record full 360-degree video up to 5K. The front of the Max features a touchscreen LCD and the camera is capable of live streaming 1080p video, making it an appealing option for vloggers. In keeping with its GoPro Hero heritage, it's waterproof to 5m.
