ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: Nikon has updated its entry-level DSLR offering with the addition of a 24MP CMOS sensor. This makes it equal to Sony's A65, A77 and NEX-7 in offering the highest pixel count we've yet seen at the APS-C sensor size, and second only to the full-frame professional-grade D800 in Nikon's entire range. The significant thing, though, is that it does so at a starting price of $699 (the same launch price as the D3100 and Panasonic DMC G3, for comparison). It may not be revolutionary, but it promises a lot of camera for a competitive amount of money.

    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: Novice photographers that want a capable, versatile DSLR that they won't outgrow in a hurry and experienced photographers looking for a good-value second camera to a more expensive DSLR.
        NotSoGoodFor: Fans of LCD image composition, who will be disappointed by the slow AF, and anyone who wants filter effects at the point of capture.
        Conclusion: The Nikon D3200 is a no-nonsense, ‘traditional style’ entry-level DSLR that is a solid performer on all levels. It doesn't offer much in terms of innovative features, but comes with the highest pixel-count in its class and good image quality across the ISO range. Just consider getting some high-quality Nikkor glass with it to make the most out of its high pixel count.
