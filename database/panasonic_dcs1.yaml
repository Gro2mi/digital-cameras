ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The DC-S1 is one of two of Panasonic's new line of full-frame mirrorless cameras. It uses the L-mount originally developed by Leica and supports lenses from the German manufacturer along with Panasonic and Sigma. The S1 features a 24MP sensor, in-body shake reduction that works in conjunction with stabilized lenses, and Panasonic's Depth from Defocus contrast-detect AF system. Other features include an ultra-high-res EVF, double-hinged LCD, top panel LCD and dual memory card slots (SD and XQD). The S1 is capable of capturing 4K/60p video. The magnesium alloy body is weather-resistant and has a shutter rated to 400k cycles.

    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: Those seeking a stills/video hybrid camera with a solid, weather-sealed body with excellent image and video quality.
        NotSoGoodFor: Photographers requiring a top-notch autofocus system. Those looking for a lighter, more portable body.
        Conclusion: The Panasonic Lumix DC-S1 is an incredibly well-built (but heavy) camera with excellent image and video quality. The body has numerous control points and is highly customizable. The S1's built-in image stabilization is effective, and the camera can use this system to produce ultra-high-res stills. Autofocus is speedy and accurate in most situations, though the continuous AF experience can be frustrating when using the EVF. Video quality is excellent, with 4K/60p support and numerous capture controls, and more on the way via a paid upgrade. While it's more expensive than its peers, the S1 is great for a variety of use cases, and is worth your consideration if you don't mind its size and weight.
