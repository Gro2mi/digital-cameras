ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The Pentax K-500 is a stripped-down version of the K-50, lacking the weather-sealed body and electronic level of that model. The K-500 also includes AA batteries instead of a lithium-ion battery, though the latter can be purchased. It can shoot continuously at up to 6 frames per second, has a maximum shutter speed of 1/6000th of a second and can capture video at 1080p30.
