ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The PEN-F is a compact system camera which is built around a 20 megapixel Live MOS sensor and 5-Axis Image Stabilization. A built-in 2.36 million-dot OLED electronic viewfinder is a first for the PEN-series, and a new Creative Dial on the front of the camera provides quick access to creative filter effects. In addition, the PEN-F’s vari-angle, touch-enabled LCD monitor lets users compose Live View shots from a variety of angles, high or low.

    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: Style-conscious shooters wanting a camera that looks as good as it performs. The PEN F's articulating touchscreen in particular, coupled with its abilities to accurately use face detect make it a good choice for candid shooters or street photographers. And its rangefinder-style design makes the PEN F best paired with prime lenses.
        NotSoGoodFor: Sports and action shooter seeking a camera that can both fire bursts, while maintaining focus on a moving subject. Hard-core videographers. Anyone who wants to affix anything other than a prime lens.
        Conclusion: |-
            The PEN F is a fashionable as it is functional. Pairing many of the same guts found in the enthusiast OM-D E-M5 II with a brand-new 20MP sensor, the PEN F is a highly capable shooter offering good image quality and decent video quality. Features like image stabilization prove extremely useful during both still and video capture and the camera's six film presets are especially appealing if you're a JPEG shooter.
            However the PEN F's MSRP puts it into a crowded class of cameras. And while it is not the most technically capable of the bunch, it is easily the most beautifully-engineered and simply put, a pleasure to shoot with.
