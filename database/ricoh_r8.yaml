ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: Upgrade to the R7 increases the resolution to  10 megapixels and adds a lovely high resolution screen but retains the  compact styling and versatile 28-200 equiv. 7x zoom. With a wealth of  useful and often novel features (not least the big lens in a small  body) the R8 is an attractive proposition, but it's let down slightly  by its over-processed high ISO images, poor low light performance and  lack of responsiveness. Not a bad camera, but not a great one either.
