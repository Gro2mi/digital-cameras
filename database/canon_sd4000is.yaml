ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: Ultra-compact camera featuring the company's new 'HS' system that promises better low-light performance and high-speed photography through a combination of a 10MP back-illuminated CMOS sensor and DIGIC 4 processor. It sports a 28-105mm equivalent f/2.0-5.3 stabilized zoom lens (offering the same range as the S90 but for a smaller sensor), 3 inch LCD and P/A/S/M shooting modes. The camera also features a Super Slow Motion movie mode that records 340x240 movies at 240fps, as well as 720p HD movies capture. It's not Earth-shattering but, if you want a point-and-shoot (with entirely optional user control), the SD4000 IS pretty much peerless.

    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: Most shooting situations - the SD4000 IS is a great all-rounder. It's fast, easy-to-use and produces dependable image quality. It also looks good and fits easily in most pockets.
        NotSoGoodFor: Super-sized prints or highest-quality creative photography. In low light it's still a small sensor compact so it can't compete with DSLR or mirrorless cameras for ultimate image quality.
        Conclusion: The SD4000 IS is born into a long and well-respected line of compact cameras and does its family proud. It offers flexibility, image quality and a good level of user control while remaining distinctly easy to use. Only the screen (large chunks of which are regularly unused), is a disappointment.
