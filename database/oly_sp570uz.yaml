ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: At launch the SP-570 (replacement for the SP-560 UZ) sported the longest built-in zoom on the market, covering an incredibly versatile 26-520mm (equiv.) range. In most respects it's very similar to all the other 'SLR-like' super zoom cameras on the market, with electronic viewfinder, full photographic control and a wealth of features and controls. We reviewed close relation the SP-565 UZ and found it to offer decent image quality that only really gives cause for complaint at high ISO settings. CCD-shift image stabilization struggles at the long end of a zoom this big.
