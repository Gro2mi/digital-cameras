ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The Sony Cyber-shot DSC-TX100V has a 16MP CMOS sensor which is capable of outputting 60fps 1080p movies. It also boasts an OLED display with touch-screen controls, and Sweep Multi-Angle - a simulated 3D shooting mode sweep that lets you view images moving in simulated 3D right on the TX100V's display by tilting the camera back and forth. The DSC-TX100V model also has an HDR feature that compiles the highlights, mid-tones and shadows from three separate shots to create a single image with a wide dynamic range.
