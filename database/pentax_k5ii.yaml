ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The 16MP Pentax K-5 II  DSLR is the company's 2012 flagship camera. It is built around a weather-sealed magnesium alloy and is bundled with the SAFOX X, autofocus sensor. This is designed to work in lower light than any of its rivals (down to -3EV) it will also provide greater accuracy when working with F2.8 and fast lenses. The SAFOX X also features more sophisticated focus tracking, to keep focus when the subject moves off the original focus point.Though they don't represent hugely significant upgrades to the original K-5, the Pentax K-5 II and its close relative the K-5 IIS still hold their own in the current SLR market, with excellent image quality from a proven 16MP CMOS sensor, solid build, and a well thought-out interface. We like the tight, simple design of the K-5 II, one that offers quick access to a rich feature-set.

    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: Enthusiast and pro photographers, particularly those with leanings toward outdoor photography.
        NotSoGoodFor: Consumer users who are likely to want better access to, and higher performance from live view and movie modes.
        Conclusion: A good, solid, weather-sealed camera with a tried-and-true sensor, the Pentax K-5 II remains a solid digital SLR that's easy to recommend. With a decided bent toward enthusiast users, the Pentax K-5 II pairs well with the company's line of Limited lenses, and is good to have along with a weather-resistant lens on a rainy day.
