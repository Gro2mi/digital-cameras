ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The Fujifilm X10 is an enthusiast compact with a F2.0-2.8, 28-112mm-equivalent lens. It's built around a 2/3" (6.6 x 8.8mm) CMOS sensor that uses Fujifilm's unique EXR pixel arrangement. The 12MP sensor can produce either 12MP images in high resolution mode, under-expose half its pixels to provide 6MP images with greater dynamic range, or combine neighboring pixels for a 6MP high sensitivity mode. The X10 borrows extensively from the styling of the X100 (though its zooming viewfinder means you lose the X100's hybrid viewfinder), to give a camera that sits conceptually between the Olympus XZ-2 and the Canon Powershot G15. Now superseded by the X20, the X10 remains a great choice for anyone interested in a high-quality compact camera, and don't need lots of pixels.

    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: Users who want external controls. Those who often shoot in high contrast conditions.
        NotSoGoodFor: Users who want a pocketable camera. Those who plan to regularly shoot video.
        Conclusion: The Fujifilm X10 combines retro-styled attractiveness with excellent build quality, a fast zoom lens and all the external controls you could want in a compact camera. The camera's EXR sensor technology allows for impressive dynamic range and in combination with the X10's relatively large sensor allows for very good high ISO performance.
