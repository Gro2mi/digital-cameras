ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The Olympus OM-D E-M10 IV is an entry-level Micro Four Thirds camera with a 20 Megapixel Live MOS sensor and in-body image stabilization. It offers a selfie-friendly LCD that can flip down to face the subject, with dedicated controls on the display for easy shooting. The camera also offers a 2.36 million-dot OLED electronic viewfinder. Unlike previous E-M10 models, the Mark IV can have its battery charged over USB. Battery life is above average.The camera has a 121-pt contrast-detect autofocus system. It can shoot bursts as fast as 15 fps (5 fps with continuous autofocus), with a deep buffer and quick write times when using UHS-II SD cards. The E-M10 IV has a capable Auto mode, 28 scene modes, and numerous creative filters. It has a decent (but not overwhelming) set of manual controls. The E-M10 IV can capture 4K video at up to 30p. High speed 120 fps video is only available at HD (1280 x 720).

    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: Travel, family and documentary photography, portraits, and users that want to capture smooth 4K video with a minimum of fuss.
        NotSoGoodFor: Those that need more reliable autofocus tracking and higher burst speeds for sports, action and wildlife.
        Conclusion: The Olympus OM-D E-M10 Mark IV is a handsome entry-level camera with some helpful aids for new users, but with enough controls to provide room to grow. While its autofocus and burst speeds lag the competition, its stand-out feature is an effective in-body stabilizer, especially handy for low-light stills and handheld video shooting. In all, the E-M10 IV is a fine photographic companion for a variety of users.
