ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The Fujifilm X100V is a rangefinder-style camera with a fixed 35mm equiv. F2 lens. It has a unique viewfinder that can be optical or electronic, along with a tilting touchscreen LCD. The camera has dials for just about everything, giving it the feel of cameras from days past. The X100V uses Fujifilm's 26MP X-Trans CMOS sensor along with the company's latest AF system, which includes face and eye detection. In addition to taking high-res stills, the X100V can also capture both DCI and UHD 4K video for up to 10 minutes, and supports F-Log and Eterna.

    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: Street and documentary photography and videography, environmental portraiture, social snapshots, travel.
        NotSoGoodFor: Vlogging, sports and action where longer focal lengths are required, high-res landscape photography.
        Conclusion: The X100V is an engaging, well-built camera that produces beautiful images, has best-in-class video, excellent autofocus and optional weather-sealing. Meaningful updates like a tilting touchscreen, updated viewfinder and redesigned lens have us largely looking past its imperfections. Assuming you like the 35mm-equivalent focal length, it makes a strong case as a photographer's carry-everywhere compact that's good for all kinds of photography.
