    ExecutiveSummary: 'Manufacturer description: The Panasonic LUMIX DMC-GH4 (GH4) is the world’s first DSLM with 4K cinematic recording capability. The newly developed 16.05-megapixel Digital Live MOS Sensor for the GH4 excels both in sensitivity and response and suppresses rolling shutter effect even when using the electronic shutter. The Venus Engine image processor has been newly developed dramatically boosting its performance with a new quad-core CPU that allows high speed signal processing that is required for rich 4K video recording. Integrating superior noise reduction systems, the GH4 enables shooting at maximum ISO 25,600. Sensitivity, gradation performance, resolution and color reproduction are dramatically improved to achieve even higher picture quality. The GH4 boasts high speed burst shooting at 12 frames per second (AFS) up to approx.40 (including RAW) / approx.100 (excluding RAW) and 7.0 fps(AFC) to capture fast moving subjects.'

    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: Enthusiast film makers and anyone who cares as much about their movie footage as their still images.
        NotSoGoodFor: Sports photographers or landscape shooters looking for the pinnacle of image quality.
        Conclusion: Despite increased competition, the GH4 remains the most complete stills/video camera on the market. It's a competitive stills camera in its own right but the attention to detail when it comes to the provision of movie-shooting tools and capabilities makes it a stand-out camera.
