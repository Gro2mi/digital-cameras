ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The Olympus TG-series of waterproof cameras remains a popular choice for enthusiasts looking for a rugged compact camera. The TG-3 retains lens specifications of the TG-2 with a bright 25-100mm F2.0-4.9 lens, but improves on its predecessor with the addition of built-in Wi-Fi that syncs with Android and iOS devices. The Wi-Fi connectivity allows data transfer, social media connectivity, and full camera control. The TG-3 also features a microscope mode that can capture images as close as 10mm away from the subject and magnify up to 6.9x and up to 13.8x with Super Resolution Zoom.A lineup of optional system accessories are available for the TG-3, including waterproof fisheye and tele converter lenses, an LED right light, an underwater protector, float straps and multipurpose camera cases are sold separately.

    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: Skiers, climbers, and divers looking for a responsive and very rugged camera that can shoot for a full day (and more)
        NotSoGoodFor: Video enthusiasts and those seeking manual exposure controls.
        Conclusion: The Olympus TG-3 is a very solid and capable rugged camera that offers a fast lens (at wide-angle), an excellent LCD, fast performance, and top notch battery life. Image quality isn't great when viewed at 100%  - and exposure needs to be watched underwater - but most people will be happy with the results.
