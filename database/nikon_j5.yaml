ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The Nikon 1 J5 is a compact mirrorless camera with a more 'retro' design that its predecessor and now has a secondary control dial. It uses a new 1"-type 20.8MP BSI CMOS sensor with on-chip phase detection. Combined with a new image processing engine (Expeed 5A), this allows the camera to shoot continuously at 20 fps with continuous AF and 60 fps without. Other features include a 3" touchscreen LCD that tilts upward 180 degrees for 'selfie shooting', numerous special effects, and Wi-Fi with NFC. Video can be recorded at 1080/60p, 720/120p, and 4K/15p.
