ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: Boasting the world's fastest burst shooting (up to 60 frames per second) and movie capture at up to 1200 fps, the EX-F1 has developed something of a cult following thanks to its ability to produce the kind of slow-motion footage that once required specialized equipment. The SLR-like styling and 36-432mm (equiv.) 12x zoom are pretty standard fare and the 6MP stills are far from class-leading, but the ability to shoot 1080P movies, the ultra high speed shooting modes and the extensive feature set will undoubtedly appeal to the gadget lover wanting something a little different. Unfortunately no matter how appealing the slow-mo movies, the price - around $1000 at launch - is going to be hard for many to justify, especially with the launch of the EX-FH20, which has a better mix of features and a far more appealing price.
