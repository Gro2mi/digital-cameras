    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: Those who want more than day of shooting on a single battery charge. Frequent portrait photographers. Those on a budget.
        NotSoGoodFor: Those demanding a high quality LCD and viewfinder, video shooters.
        Conclusion: The Samsung WB2200F is one of the most interesting superzooms in that it has a built-in battery grip which, in addition to making portrait shooting more comfortable, pays dividends when it comes to battery life. The camera has the widest lens in the group, starting at 20mm, and above-average image stabilization. That said, we were disappointed with both the washed out LCD and low resolution EVF, as well as the limited controls in movie mode (which does not support 1080/60p recording, either).
