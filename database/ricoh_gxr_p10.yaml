ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The P10 28-300mm F3.5-5.6 VC is a lens unit that slides into Ricoh's GXR body. The GXR system takes a novel approach by offering interchangeable slide mount 'lens units' - sealed modules containing both optics and sensor, meaning it can switch from a large (APS-C) sensor with a fast prime lens to a tiny one with zoom lenses (such as the P10). The Ricoh GXR/P10 28-300mm combines a 10MP back-illuminated CMOS sensor with a 28-300mm lens, turning the GXR into a 'Travel Zoom' compact camera.It offers tank-like construction and a user interface that is a step above most cameras with similar sensor/lens combinations. However, the image quality is pretty much typical for a travel zoom compact camera and cannot match the camera's build quality and operation. You'll have to decide for yourself if the GXR's unique concept justifies its premium price, similarly specified travel zoom cameras are available at a more attractive price point.

    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: Users who want the flexibility of a travel zoom lens and DSLR-like controls in a relatively small package.
        NotSoGoodFor: Anyone who requires better than compact camera image quality.
        Conclusion: The GXR P10 28-300mm VC comes with GXR's excellent user interface and operation but the lens/sensor combination in the camera module only produces average compact camera image quality.
