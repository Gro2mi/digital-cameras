ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The Sony Cyber-shot DSC-TX30 is the world's slimmest digital compact camera that is waterproof to 10m, freeze- and shock-proof. It has an ultra-slim metal body, which you can easily slide into the smallest of pockets. Its touchscreen OLED display is one of the best in this class - at least indoors. The TX30 also has a host of useful features that work very well. Its main problems are mostly related to its display. It's very difficult to see outdoors, scratches easily, and the camera becomes nearly useless underwater, since the capacitive touchscreen does not function.

    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: Those seeking an ultra-thin rugged camera with a fun feature set that can get a little wet.
        NotSoGoodFor: Serious underwater photographers, those taking flash photos or shooting in bright outdoor light. People who want a built-in GPS.
        Conclusion: The Cyber-shot DSC-TX30 is an ultra-thin rugged camera for those who don't want to worry about the camera getting a little wet. Underwater enthusiasts should note though that the touchscreen display does not work underwater, and the otherwise beautiful OLED display is also difficult to see outdoors. Photo quality from this stylish compact is decent for its class, but compared to its competitors the main reason to buy a TX30 is that it doesn't look like a tough camera.
