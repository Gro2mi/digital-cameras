ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The DMC-TS3/FT3 rugged compact inherits core features from previous generation of weatherproof compacts and adds a built-in GPS function, a compass, altimeter and barometer. The body also gets a cosmetic makeover offering a better grip while retaining its pocketability. It is dustproof, waterproof up to depths of 12m (40 feet), shockproof against a drop of up to 2 meters (6.6 ft), and freezeproof down to -10 degrees C (14F). Along with the still photography features, the camera offers full 1080i60 HD video recording capability along with Panasonic's latest Active mode for less shaky videos and a 3D photo mode.

    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: High quality everyday photography and videography in virtually any situation.
        NotSoGoodFor: Users who do not want to adjust manual settings, as the DMC-TS3 has some nice features that must be turned on manually, like its LED light.
        Conclusion: The Panasonic DMC-TS3 is one of the best-featured and best-performing cameras in the 'rugged' compact camera class. It is capable of delivering consistently high quality images and video in just about any circumstances, and its operations are very straightforward.
