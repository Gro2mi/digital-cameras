ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The latest incarnation of Canon's enthusiast full-frame 5D series is the EOS 5D Mark III. The camera has been improved over its predecessor in most areas and comes with a 22MP full-frame sensor, 6 frames per second continuous shooting and 1080p video at 24, 25 or 30 fps, offering the high quality intraframe (All-I) compression method and greater audio control. A 61-point AF system and 63-zone metering provide focusing speed and metering accuracy.The 5D Mark III is a great camera and for current 5D Mark II users or other owners of Canon full-frame lenses the all-important question 'Should I buy one?' is an easy one to answer. The 5D Mark III is in almost every aspect a better camera than its predecessor and an extremely enjoyable photographic tool. Competing models like the Nikon D800/E have a few unique tricks up their sleeve (36MP capture and an option to record uncompressed video footage) but for most people, most of the time, the differences wouldn't be important enough to warrant swapping systems.

    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: Photographers who want an extremely versatile photographic tool that is capable of great results in many shooting situations.
        NotSoGoodFor: JPEG only shooters
        Conclusion: The Canon EOS 5D Mark III is not only a very capable photographic tool in almost all areas, it's also fun and exciting to shoot with. Slight JPEG softness is disappointing in a camera at this level but it's only visible at pixel-level and we would expect most of the camera's target group to shoot Raw anyway.
