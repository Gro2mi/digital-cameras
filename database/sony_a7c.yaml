    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: Travel photography, an always-with-you family camera
        NotSoGoodFor: Dedicated videographers
        Conclusion: The Sony a7C is gives up very little in the way of features in order to achieve its small size. Its image quality is very good and its AF is excellent, but its small viewfinder takes away from the experience a little. Its video and menus aren't as polished as its rivals but its size and battery life make for a powerful combination.
