    ExecutiveSummary: The K-3 touts 24 megapixels in an APS-C sized CMOS sensor with the world’s first selectable anti-aliasing filter—giving the user the ability to easily toggle anti-aliasing functionality on or off by way of the PENTAX-original SR (Shake Reduction) mechanism. As a replacement for both the K-5 II and K-5 IIS, improvements include a top shooting speed up to 8.3 FPS and a new autofocus module with 27 AF sensors and a vast light sensitivity range of –3EV to +18EV. Using optional FLU card SDHC technology, the K-3 offers complete remote camera control, including aperture, shutter speed, ISO, focus points, shutter release and image transfer to laptops and compatible devices. Other enthusiast pleasing features include H.264 video capture, dual memory card slots, Live View, an electronic level, and weather sealing in a magnesium alloy body.
