ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: One of a pair of near identical twins (the other being the DSC-T90), the DSC-T900 has the usual T series attributes; ultra slim styling, sliding lens cover and simple point-and-shoot operation. The 12 megapixel sensor can also deliver 720p HD movies (MPEG4 format) and Sony's latest intelligent automatic systems. The whole thing is finished off with a large, high resolution (921k pixel) 3.5" screen and useful 35-140mm (equiv.) 5x zoom with optical image stabilization. The less expensive T-90 has a smaller, lower resolution screen but is otherwise pretty much the same camera. April 2009
