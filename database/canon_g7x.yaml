    ExecutiveSummary: The PowerShot G7 X is the company's first compact camera with a 1"-type sensor. This 20.2MP BSI-CMOS sensor is paired with Canon's latest DIGIC 6 image processor, and offers an ISO range of 125-12800. The lens has a fast maximum aperture range of F1.8-2.8 and equivalent focal range of 24-100mm. It has a 9-blade curved aperture diagram as well as an ND filter. The G7 X has a compact metal body with a control dial around the lens, a dedicated exposure comp dial on the top, and the usual rear dial on the rear. The 3" touchscreen LCD can be flipped up by 180 degrees, perfect for self-portraits.The 'high speed' autofocus system features 31 points which, combined with the image processor, allows for 6.5 fps continuous shooting. Video can be recorded at 1080/60p with manual controls.  The G7 X also has built-in Wi-Fi, which allows for photo and video sharing via Canon's Image Gateway service.

    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: Those seeking big sensor photo quality in your pocket. On-the-go portrait photographers. Self-portrait enthusiasts.
        NotSoGoodFor: Those who don't want to carry around  extra batteries. Raw shooters. Video enthusiasts.
        Conclusion: With a time-tested 1" BSI-CMOS sensor and an impressive 24-100mm F1.8-2.8 lens, the PowerShot G7 X produces excellent quality photos.
