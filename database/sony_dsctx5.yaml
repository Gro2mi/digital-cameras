ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: At the time of its release in February 2010, Sony claimed that the Cyber-shot TX5 was the world's slimmest rugged compact. Measuring 17.7mm (0.69") on its thinnest side, it features a 10.2MP back-illuminated CMOS sensor and a 3.0" touchscreen LCD that works underwater. The company's first rugged compact, it is designed to be dustproof, waterproof up to 3 meters, coldproof down to -10°C (14°F) and shock-resistant for drops of up to 1.5 meters. It was released with a range of optional waterproof accessories.
