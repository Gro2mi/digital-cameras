ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: Successor to the popular A700. Aside from a design facelift and a few feature tweaks the biggest - and most welcome - change is that the new model adds optical image stabilization, something we bemoaned the lack of on the A700. There's also an extra million pixels ( up from 6 to 7MP) and the usual A series mix of manual and automatic features. Like all A series we've reviewed, the image quality is good for a budget model, and there's plenty of useful features too
