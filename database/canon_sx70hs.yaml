ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The Canon PowerShot SX70 HS is a super-zoom point-and-shoot camera with a 65x, 21-1365mm equivalent F3.4-6.5 lens and 20MP BSI-CMOS sensor. The camera is powered by Canon's latest Digic 8 processor which allows for fast bursts and 4K video capture. As you'd expect, its long lens is stabilized, with up to five stops of shake reduction. Photos can be composed on a fully articulating 3" display or a high-res OLED electronic viewfinder. The SX70 is Canon's first point & shoot camera to support its new CR3 Raw format.The SX70 can shoot continuously at 10 fps with single AF and 5.7 fps with continuous AF.  UHD 4K video can be captured at 30 fps, and a high speed 120 fps mode is available at Full HD resolution. Wireless connectivity includes Wi-Fi and Bluetooth.
