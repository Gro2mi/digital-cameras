ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: Equipped with a 24 Megapixel APS-C CMOS sensor and DIGIC 8 processor, Canon's EOS Rebel T8i (EOS 850D in most regions) is the company's 'high-end entry-level' DSLR. When shooting through the viewfinder there's a 45-point all-cross-type AF system, while Canon's excellent Dual Pixel AF is available for live view and video capture using the camera's fully articulating touchscreen. When in live view, the camera offers both face and eye detection. 4K video can be captured at 24p and Full HD at 60p. Vloggers will appreciate the ability to shoot vertical video. The camera features a 3.5mm input for an external microphone. Connectivity options include Wi-Fi and Bluetooth.

    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: Amateur photographers looking for a solid camera to learn and grow with, users looking for a fairly compact camera with an optical viewfinder.
        NotSoGoodFor: Photographers that want the best autofocus and exposure performance through the viewfinder, users that are looking for good 4K video and those looking for even more compact options.
        Conclusion: The Canon EOS Rebel T8i is well-built with comfortable ergonomics and provides solid image quality for users that prefer an optical viewfinder. Unfortunately, its video capabilities aren't that impressive, and the viewfinder autofocus system is a little basic compared to what you get on mirrorless cameras through their electronic finders. Still, if you're in the market for a reasonably affordable DSLR, the EOS Rebel T8i is worth a look.
