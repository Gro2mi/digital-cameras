ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: Distinguished by its impressively small form factor, the Canon EOS 100D shares the 18MP resolution, DIGIC 5 processor, 3" touchscreen and 1080p30 video capability of the mirrorless EOS M. Canon's hybrid phase/contrast detect AF system has been tweaked, however, to provide much greater scene coverage, and this tiny DSLR can shoot at up to 4 fps.

    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: Users who want to shoot in Live View and record movies, but also want the benefits of an APS-C digital SLR in a smaller body.
        NotSoGoodFor: Enthusiasts looking for more bells and whistles, like an articulating LCD or wireless remote control of flash.
        Conclusion: The Canon EOS Rebel SL1 / 100D is an ideal camera for consumer users looking for better image quality, with improved Live View and movie-mode autofocus in a small body. Its touchscreen interface offers a modern set of digital controls in a camera that will still feel familiar to more traditional SLR users.
