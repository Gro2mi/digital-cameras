ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The Fujifilm Finepix X-Pro1 is the start of an all-new camera system, with a brand new mount and lenses. It's unashamedly targeted at a high-end audience, with analogue control dials and a small set of compact, large-aperture primes available at launch. Fujifilm is keen to stress its future commitment to the system, with a promise of seven more lenses by spring 2013, and further camera models to come too. In a way the X-Pro1 has no direct competitors; its optical viewfinder and traditional stills-focused control layout sets it apart from the likes of the Sony NEX-7, and of course it's much less expensive than the camera it physically most resembles, the Leica M9-P, and operates rather differently too. This alone should ensure it a niche in the market, and we suspect many buyers will be delighted with it.    The problem that Fujifilm faces, though, is that it's still an expensive camera in the grand scheme of things, and one that has to be measured up against the best of its peers in all aspects of design and operation. While it passes with flying colours in terms of image quality, certain operational aspects are still problematic. A particular weak point is focus - AF performance is humdrum at best, and manual focus is distinctly flawed.

    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: Photographers looking for a combination of excellent image quality, traditional dial-based handling and discreet operation in an interchangable-lens camera.
        NotSoGoodFor: Shooting moving subjects, video work
        Conclusion: The X-Pro1 marks Fujifilm's entry into the high-end mirrorless interchangeable-lens market, and combines excellent image quality with fluid handling. The hybrid optical/electronic viewfinder is excellent, but autofocus is relatively slow and manual focus doesn't work very well.
