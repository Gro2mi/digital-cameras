    ExecutiveSummary: 'Manufacturer description: The new compact sized DSC-QX30 camera brings the power and versatility of a 30x optical zoom lens to mobile photographers, eliminating the frustration and poor quality commonly experienced when zooming-in using a smartphone camera.  Additionally, the extensive 30x zoom is aided by Optical SteadyShot image stabilization to minimize camera shake throughout the zoom range.Awesome zoom power is matched by lock-on AF and speedy continuous shooting at up to 10fps, letting photographers capture fast-moving action with an accurately focused burst of split-second images. For video enthusiasts, the QX30 model can also shoot Full HD video at a smooth 60p frame rate at the touch of a button.'
