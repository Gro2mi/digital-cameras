ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: Mid-sized  12 megapixel compact with a 5x zoom and optical image stabilization. 720p30 high definition movie capture and a full range of manual exposure controls broaden the appeal, but our experience of Kodak's image quality in the Z range is that they only really perform in good light at the lowest ISO settings.
