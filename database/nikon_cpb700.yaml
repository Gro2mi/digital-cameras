ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: 'Manufacturer description: The COOLPIX B700 is a compact superzoom camera that offers incredible range and outstanding image quality. Whether trying to capture birds in-flight or the star player from the sidelines, images captured will be rendered in amazing quality thanks to the camera’s impressive 20.3-megapixel BSI CMOS sensor, even when shooting in low-light. The B700 can capture impressive portraits or landscapes with a phenomenal 60x optical zoom NIKKOR ED glass lens (120x with Dynamic Fine Zoom) that expands from wide-angle to telephoto zoom for accuracy and precision in every shot. Capable of shooting at 5 frames per second (fps), fast motion is captured with ease, while a 3-inch Vari-angle LCD display helps compose unique perspectives at any angle. Other user-friendly features include a myriad of Creative Modes, RAW (NRW) shooting support, new 4K UHD video capability (30p) and Nikon SnapBridge for seamless sharing of amazing images with friends and family.'
