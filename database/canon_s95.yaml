ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The 10 million-pixel Canon Powershot S95 replaces the S90, which was released in 2009. In complete contrast to the larger boxy G-series, the Powershot S95 retains the S90's svelte, truly pocketable body design that has a lot more in common with the Ixus/Elph cameras. Inside its compact bodyshell, Canon has managed to squeeze a 28-105mm (equivalent) zoom lens, and a bright, high-resolution LCD screen. The S95 features an impressive ISO span for its class, from ISO 80-3200 at full resolution, with both RAW and JPEG recording options.
