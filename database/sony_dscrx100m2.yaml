ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The Sony Cyber-shot DSC-RX100 II is built upon the incredibly popular RX100 compact camera, adding a BSI-CMOS  20MP 1"-type sensor behind the familiar 28-100mm equivalent stabilized lens with F1.8-4.9 aperture range. In this second incarnation, the RX100 II features a tiltable LCD, multi-accessory hot shoe, and NFC-enabled built-in Wi-Fi for wireless image transfer.

    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: Available light photography, enthusiasts looking for a high-resolution lightweight compact.
        NotSoGoodFor: Budget-conscious shoppers, and anyone who really wants a viewfinder
        Conclusion: The RX100 II performs much the same as its RX100 predecessor, turning out some of the best image quality we've seen from a compact camera. With the addition of Wi-Fi connectivity and a BSI sensor, it's at the top of its class in terms of performance and features. With a few caveats regarding the shooting experience, it's a clear class-leader.
