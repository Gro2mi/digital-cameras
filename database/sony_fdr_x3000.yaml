ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The Sony X3000 has an unconventional shape which accommodates an optically stabilized lens and 8 Megapixel BSI CMOS sensor. The camera can be controlled via an LCD on its side or via an optional LCD remote. The X3000 can capture 4K/30p and 1080/120p video (and everything in-between) and supports time-lapse and live streaming. Stills can be fired off at 10 fps. Connectivity options include Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. The X3000 is splash and freezeproof right out of the box and an included housing allows it to dive up to 60m/197ft underwater.
