ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: Successor - in spirit at least - to the classic FinePix F30/F31fd, the F100fd offers class-leading low light image quality (though the margin is closing) and overall produces some of the best results of any compact camera - whatever the shooting conditions. This, plus the useful 28-140mm equiv. (5x) zoom range and responsive operation, add up to such an appealing  package that we're prepared to overlook the dated design, horrible user interface and lack of manual controls. The F100fd has since been joined at the top of the FinePix range by the F200EXR, which uses Fujifilm's next generation EXR sensor technology. (April 2009)
