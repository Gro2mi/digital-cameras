ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: Successor to the S1000FD (at the time  the world's smallest 12x zoom camera), the FinePix S1500 is the latest in a long line of very compact SLR-styled big zoom cameras designed to appeal to those wanting a lot of lens on a tight budget. The big change is the inclusion of optical (CCD shift) image stabilization, making the long zoom a lot more usable in less than perfect light, and  for the money you're getting a lot of features - including full photographic controls and a 7.5fps burst mode (at reduced resolution) - in a lightweight package.
