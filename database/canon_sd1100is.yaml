ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: Replacement for the SD1000 (Ixus 70) offers solid, if slightly uninspiring feature set in a stylish and well made slimline casing. The SD1100IS is a 'typical' IXUS/SD in many respects. It is compact, well built and sports a reasonably attractive design. It offers good output quality in most situations - straight out of the box - only requiring minimal user intervention. It is also typical in so far as you won't find any groundbreaking innovations on the spec sheet. As usual Canon has chosen the safe route by sticking to what they know best. If it is the extraordinary you are after, go and look somewhere else. . (April 2009)
