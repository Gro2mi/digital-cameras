ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: 'The Fujifilm X-Pro3 is a unique mirrorless camera with a hybrid viewfinder and LCD that is only viewable when flipped down. Its viewfinder can be optical with guidelines and shooting information overlaid, or fully electronic. When the LCD is closed, an additional display on the rear of the camera shows shooting information or the current Film Simulation mode.The X-Pro3 has a 26MP APS-C X-Trans CMOS sensor, the same as on the X-T3, along with a hybrid autofocus system. The LCD flips down by up to 180 degrees and has a resolution of 1.62 million-dots. The viewfinder has a magnification of 0.52x when used optically and 0.66x when used as an EVF. The EVF has an OLED panel with 3.69 million dots. It has a USB 3.1 Type-C port and a 2.5mm remote/microphone socket. The camera offers two new Film Simulation modes: Classic Neg. and Monochromatic color. It can capture 4K video at up to 30p, with a max bit rate of 200Mbps. The X-Pro3 has a 2.5mm mic input, which can also be used for a wired remote, along with a Type C USB 3.1 socket. Wireless options include Wi-Fi plus Bluetooth.The camera body is weather-sealed and has titanium top and bottom plates. It comes in both regular and ''DuraTech'' finishes, with the latter being scratch-resistant.'

    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: Street and enthusiast photographers looking for something a bit different.
        NotSoGoodFor: Sports or zoom-lens shooters. Photographers looking for a do-everything workhorse.
        Conclusion: The X-Pro3 is a unique mirrorless camera, and will appeal to those who want a waist-level screen or an optical viewfinder experience. It'll be a camera you either covet or don’t see the value of, but that polarization is the X-Pro 3’s defining characteristic, and some photographers will find it very compelling.
