ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: In recent years Panasonic has been attacking the budget end of the market far more aggressively, allowing features from its high-end models to trickle down into cameras such as this one, which offers a remarkably comprehensive feature set for very little money. It's not the prettiest camera in the world, but   it offers considerably more 'bang for your buck' than most cameras at this level.
