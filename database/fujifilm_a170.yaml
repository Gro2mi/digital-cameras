ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: Fujifilm's budget 'A' series cameras have got a lot more stylish - and a lot slimmer - in recent years, but the basic feature set remains just that; basic. The budget Fujifilm A170 is based around a 10MP sensor, 3x (32-96mm equiv) zoom lens and a 2.7 inch LCD. There are 16 scene modes, Auto Scene Recognition and a Panorama mode. Remarkably thin at 21.9 mm, the new 10 megapixel model is available with a high gloss-double coated veneer finish.
