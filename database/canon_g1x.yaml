ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The Canon PowerShot G1 X may look like the company's previous G-series compacts, but is a very different prospect. It's a large sensor (only 20% smaller than the sensors Canon uses in most of its DSLRs) camera with a flexible 28-112mm-equivalent, 4x zoom lens and extensive manual controls. The company says it sees it as a camera for photographers who already have a high end DSLR such as a 5D Mark II or 7D, but at a price of $799, we think it'll appeal much more widely than that. After repeated waves of cameras aimed at point-and-shoot upgraders, it's heartening to see a camera really living up to the billing of a 'serious compact.' Overall, the G1 X is an excellent camera for some but not for everyone. If you are aware of its shortcomings, such as the sluggish AF, limited close-focusing capability or lack of manual control in video, and think you can live with them, the Canon gives you great image quality and a versatile zoom range in a small package and without the need to carry a stack of lenses.

    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: Anyone who wants DSLR-like image quality and a versatile zoom range in a pocketable format.
        NotSoGoodFor: Sports and action photographers, serious videographers
        Conclusion: The G1 X is an excellent camera for some but not for everyone. The camera  gives you great image quality and a versatile zoom range in a small package without the need to carry a stack of lenses. However, the sluggish AF, limited close-focusing capability, and lack of manual control in video mode will make some users look elsewhere.
