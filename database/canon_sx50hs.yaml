ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The PowerShot SX50 HS is the world’s first 50x optical zoom compact stills camera. The PowerShot SX50 HS retains many of the features of the SX40 that came before it. They include a 12.1 Megapixel CMOS sensor, DIGIC 5 processor, rotating LCD display, manual controls, a hot shoe, and a handy Zoom Framing Assist feature. Some new features include RAW support, a slightly larger/sharper LCD, faster AF and continuous shooting speeds, and more available scenes in Smart Auto mode. With its 24 - 1200mm equivalent lens, there's really no type of scene the SX50 HS can't capture, given favorable conditions. It's not the best camera for low light or fast action though as its lens is slow and continuous shooting lackluster.

    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: Travel photography, where the 24-1200mm lens is really invaluable for framing everything from intimate interiors to distant details
        NotSoGoodFor: Shooting action, sports or kids playing - the slow lens and limited continuous shooting options will quickly become frustrating.
        Conclusion: The Canon PowerShot SX50 HS boasts the most ambitious lens of any camera in its class, and in favorable conditions it's hard to beat in terms of framing versatility. Image quality compares well to its competitors, and we like the camera's ergonomics (although a zoom control on the lens would be very welcome) but where the SX50 HS falls down is highlight clipping in JPEGs, a relatively slow lens and sub-par operational speed, which compares rather poorly to its peers.
