ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The Nikon D3500 is the company's entry-level DSLR camera. It's essentially the same as its predecessor, the D3400, except that it now uses the same body as the D5600. It continues to have a 24MP APS-C CMOS sensor, EXPEED 4 image processor, Full HD video capture and an easy-to-use interface. The camera has an ISO range of 100-25600, an 11-point autofocus system and can shoot continuously at 5 fps. The camera's Guide Mode makes it easy to learn how to shoot in various situations. While it doesn't have Wi-Fi, the D3400 has Bluetooth connectivity for transferring images from the camera to a smartphone, albeit slowly.

    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: Beginners who want the DSLR experience
        NotSoGoodFor: Video shooters or anyone expecting a phone-like 'WYSIWYG' shooting experience.
        Conclusion: |-
            The D3500 is a compact and likeable DSLR for beginners. It's not great for video and its image transfer is slow. But for stills it's a solid choice
            and its Guide Mode makes it easy to learn.
