ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The Panasonic Lumix DMC-GX1 is an enthusiast-oriented model that bears more than a passing resemblance to the Lumix DMC-GF1. The GX1 sports a 16MP 'Live MOS' sensor, a maximum ISO sensitivity setting of 12,800, a touchscreen interface and a revamped AF system. The GX1 is also the first camera compatible with Panasonic's brand new high-resolution LVF2 viewfinder, sold separately. The GX1 is a camera that gets a whole lot right. Assessing it against its true predecessor, the GF1, you'd have to look very hard to find areas in which it does not represent a clear improvement. Panasonic has addressed almost every criticism of its early generation G-series cameras in a package that, when paired with its collapsible kit zoom is among the most pocketable cameras in its class.We can't help but feel though that the wealth of competition in today's mirrorless market makes the GX1 a less exciting camera now than it would have been even a year ago. Sony's NEX-5N, not to mention the NEX-7 and Samsung's NX200 make compelling cases for a look at alternatives beyond the Micro Four Thirds realm.

    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: Enthusiasts who crave external controls in a small form factor body. Users with an investment in Micro Four Thirds lenses looking for good high ISO noise performance.
        NotSoGoodFor: Budget-conscious users who prefer an EVF and shooters who plan to devote significant time to shooting video.
        Conclusion: The GX1 packages external camera control points and a class-leading touchscreen interface in a classically-styled small form factor that produces the best image quality we've yet seen from a Micro Four Thirds camera.
