ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: 'Fujifilm''s first compact superzoom takes on the likes of Panasonic''s TZ series with a useful 27-270mm zoom in a very small body (it''s currently the smallest 10x camera on the market). It also sports the company''s latest 10MP ''Super CCD EXR'' switchable sensor, which offers some clever new features and promises wider dynamic range / better low light performance (according to the mode selected). How well it delivers on this promise is another matter: the expanded dynamic range mode works well, but whether the 5MP low light output has any real advantage over its competitors is questionable - and the lack of HD video is unusual in this sector.'
