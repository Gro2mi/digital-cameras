ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The X-M1 is the third model in Fujifilm's X-system after the X-Pro1 and X-E1, and offers a distinctly different design approach with no eye-level viewfinder, a tilting rear-screen, and dual electronic control dials. It uses Fujifilm's proprietary 16MP X-Trans CMOS sensor which offers an ISO range of 200-6400 in RAW and 100-25600 in JPEG, and is also capable of Full HD movie recording at 30 fps. Despite the camera's small size there's still a decent amount of external control, meaning the camera should appeal to beginners and  enthusiasts alike.

    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: Those seeking a relatively inexpensive mirrorless camera with top-notch photo quality and a wide selection of manual controls.
        NotSoGoodFor: Electronic viewfinder lovers and video enthusiasts
        Conclusion: The X-M1 is Fujifilm's entry-level mirrorless camera with its unique X-Trans sensor. While it lacks the build quality and EVF of the more expensive X-E1, it adds a sharper, tilting LCD and Wi-Fi. The X-M1 is capable of taking incredibly sharp photos with very little noise. Performance is very good, although AF speeds are not as quick as the best-in-class mirrorless cameras. The camera is missing a few other handy features, like an electronic level and remote control via Wi-Fi.
