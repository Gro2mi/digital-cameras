ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The Sony Cyber-shot DSC-HX300 is a DSLR-style compact camera built around a 50x optical zoom lens covering 24-1200mm equivalent. Offering chunkier ergonomics than smaller compact cameras, the HX300 also features a tunnel-type optical viewfinder and manual controls. Sony claims the HX300's Optical SteadyShot image stabilization system is twice as effective as the version used in previous-generation Sony superzoom compacts.
