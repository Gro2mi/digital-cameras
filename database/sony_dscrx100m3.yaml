ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The RX100 III is the most premium of pocketable premium enthusiasts compacts from Sony. Built around a 1" CMOS sensor and a 24-70mm equivalent F1.8-2.8 Zeiss lens, it promises sharp images even in low light. Other than the redesigned lens, the Mark III differs from its other RX100 siblings by including a built-in and retractable OLED viewfinder with the same T* coating as the camera's lens to reduce flare and ghosting. The RX100 III also features built-in Wi-Fi and NFC connectivity for both wireless image sharing and camera control via smartphone, and a multi-angle WhiteMagic LCD display.

    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: Getting excellent quality images and video, on the go.
        NotSoGoodFor: Low light shooters and those who want the camera to always be ready for the next shot.
        Conclusion: The RX100 III is the most capable compact camera we've ever seen. With its built-in viewfinder and consistently fast lens, there's nothing that can provide better image quality in such a small package. It's not the perfect camera to take shot-to-shot control over, but its capability means it justifies its high price tag.
