    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: Astro and wildlife photographers, travelers, or anyone seeking the longest zoom available.
        NotSoGoodFor: Those on a budget, want a more compact camera, or shoot video frequently.
        Conclusion: The Nikon Coolpix P900's massive 83X, 24-2000mm lens puts it in a class by itself. The lens is excellent as is the image stabilization required to shoot as long focal lengths. It sports a fully articulating LCD, twin dial operation, manual exposure controls, and both GPS and Wi-Fi. Downsides include fully automatic video recording, aggressive noise reduction (and no Raw support), a bulky body and high price.
