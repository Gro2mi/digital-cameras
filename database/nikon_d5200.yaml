ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The Nikon D5200 is an upper entry-level DSLR that improves on the D5100 by offering a 24MP CMOS sensor, 1080i60 movie capability, a side-articulated 921K dot 3.0" tilt/swivel LCD and new processing filters. The D5200 is also equipped with a significantly upgraded AF system, based around the same Multi-Cam 4800DX AF sensor that is used in the D7000, and the same 2016-pixel RGB metering sensor. The D5200 is also compatible with Nikon's optional WU-1b WiFi module.Overall, the D5200 is a solid performer that, while geared towards beginning DSLR users from an operational standpoint, shares many specifications with more expensive enthusiast offerings. It combines excellent image quality and impressive high ISO performance with an articulated screen and video capabilities that hold appeal for video shooters with a post-production workflow.
