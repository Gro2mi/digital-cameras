    ExecutiveSummary: The PowerShot Zoom is a monocular-style camera with a 1/3" 12 Megapixel sensor and stabilized F5.6-6.3 lens with an equivalent focal range of 100mm or 400mm. A 2x digital zoom option increases the telephoto range to 800mm. The camera has a 2.3 million-dot electronic viewfinder (but no LCD) through which you compose photos. You can also shoot and review photos with your smartphone. In addition to taking stills, the PowerShot Zoom also captures 1080/30p video. It uses microSD cards and can be charged over its USB-C port.
