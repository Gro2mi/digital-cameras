ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The Canon PowerShot SX30 IS superzoom digital compact is the successor to the the SX20 IS. Compared to its predecessor, it features a 24-840mm equivalent wide-angle 35x zoom lens (as opposed to the SX20's 28-560mm equiv.), a slightly larger 2.7" articulated LCD and a 14.1Mp sensor. It also includes Ultrasonic (USM) and Voice Coil (VCM) motors for faster and quieter zooming and focusing. The camera offers 720p HD recording, a Miniature effect movie mode, P/A/S/M shooting modes and a Zoom Framing Assist function that helps users quickly toggle between three preset zoomed-out positions at the longer end of the lens for better framing.
