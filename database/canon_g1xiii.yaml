ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The Canon PowerShot G1 X Mark III is a reasonably compact camera with a 24MP APS-C sensor and built-in 24-72mm F2.8-5.6 lens. It features the same Dual Pixel autofocus system found on modern Canon DSLR and mirrorless cameras. It's smaller and much lighter than its predecessor and its design is nearly identical to that of the PowerShot G5 X. It's 'Dual Sensing' image stabilization system reduces shake by up to four stops. Other features include a fully articulating touchscreen display, OLED electronic viewfinder with "touchpad AF," 7 fps burst shooting with continuous AF and 1080/60p video capture. The Mark III's connectivity options include Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and NFC. The body is both dust and weather resistant.

    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: General photography, landscapes and world travelers who don't mind bringing along an extra battery or two.
        NotSoGoodFor: Those who want to be able to photograph sports or work primarily in low light.
        Conclusion: The G1 X Mark III is an impressively compact camera with a large APS-C sensor and a zoom lens with a versatile focal range. It has tons of direct controls and can produce great image quality, but is expensive and the permanently attached lens has a slow aperture range and hampers an otherwise capable, pocketable camera.
