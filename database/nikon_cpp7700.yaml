ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The Coolpix P7700 sits at the top of  Nikon's advanced point-and-shoot lineup with a 12.2MP BSI-CMOS sensor and a 28-200mm equivalent zoom lens, a relatively long telephoto reach in this class. Full 1080p video is offered, along with 8fps continuous shooting and a fully articulated 3.0 inch LCD, but there's no optical viewfinder. The P7700 provides lots of options for expansion, being compatible with the GP-1 GPS unit, and includes a hotshoe compatible with the full range of Nikon's Speedlight flashguns. Ergonomics are top-notch, with dual command dials for DSLR-like operation along with a generous, textured grip. There's a lot to like about the Coolpix P7700. It fits well in the hand, has a great selection of customizable controls, and offers plenty of manual control. Its articulating LCD makes composing photos easy, and image quality is excellent.

    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: Enthusiasts seeking a compact with great image quality at low sensitivities, a plethora of manual controls, an articulating display, and more zoom power than the competition.
        NotSoGoodFor: Photographers who will shooting RAW files continuously and don't want to wait to take the next photo. And, of course, optical viewfinder lovers.
        Conclusion: The Coolpix P7700 offers an impressive feature set, a longer zoom range than most of its competitors, a fully articulating LCD, and very good photo quality. Unfortunately, it is marred by very slow write times, especially in RAW mode which makes continuous shooting a chore, and really forces you to use the fastest memory cards available for best performance.
