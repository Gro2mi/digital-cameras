ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The G10 is the third incarnation of Canon’s flagship ‘prosumer’ compact since the G series was reinvented with the G7 in 2006. The G10 builds on the successful formula of the G9 by adding handling and control refinements, improving the LCD resolution, and, most importantly, adding a wider lens starting at 28mm (equiv.). It also retains the rangefinder styling, solid build quality and extensive external controls (plus a new and a very useful AE compensation dial). A joy to use, the G10 is let down only by the image quality, which simply isn't any better than any other half-decent compact on the market today.
