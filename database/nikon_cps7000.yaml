Featuring a 16-megapixel CMOS Sensor, Full HD Video recording with stereo sound, and a 20x optical zoom NIKKOR ED glass lens with 40x Dynamic Fine Zoom, the COOLPIX S7000’s arsenal of features makes a great ultra-slim zoom option for users in need of a capable, yet compact COOLPIX offering.  Sharing images can be done at the push of a button with the S7000’s built-in Wi-Fi and NFC connectivity. Equipped with a Target-finding AF system, users are able to pin-point their intended subject and accurately capture even fast moving scenes, like a tumbling gymnast or a runner crossing the finish line. The S7000 also allows for easy framing of any subject, using the camera’s 3-inch 460K-dot LCD display. Additionally, lens-shift VR technology helps minimize blur while the camera’s 18 scene modes provide the optimal settings for a variety of common shooting scenarios. Creative videos are a simple touch away while the camera also features a new Time-Lapse video function.'
