ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: Five years after announcing its development, and following a month-long online campaign trailing the launch, Pentax finally unveiled its much anticipated 645D medium format digital camera in March 2010. The first digital version of the company's 645 medium format camera system, it features a 40MP, 44 x 33 CCD sensor, 921k dot 3.0"" LCD and is compatible with the existing 645 system lenses. The camera will initially be available only in the Japanese market at a suggested retail price of ¥850,000 (~ US $9,400).
