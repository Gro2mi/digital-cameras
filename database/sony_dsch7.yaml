ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: Second generation (along with the slightly higher spec H9) of Sony's foray into the popular 'SLR-like' superzoom market upgrades the DSC-H2 with a new 8MP sensor, 15x zoom (now covering 31-465mm equiv. range) and a wealth of new features (including larger screen). Although the H7 is fast, is capable of pleasing results in good conditions and is packed with useful features, we were unimpressed by the redesigned user interface. The long list of small complaints about the image quality add up to a camera that's hard to wholeheartedly recommend, especially when it has so many strong competitors. Recently superceded by the CMOS-sensored DSC-HX1. (April 2009)
