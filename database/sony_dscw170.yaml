ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: One of a range of very similar W series cameras announced in early 2008, the DSC-W170 is a  competitively-priced but nicely put together 10 megapixel  metal-bodied compact with a very versatile 30-150mm (equiv.) 5x zoom and 2.7" screen - plus a fairly comprehensive feature set. The closely-related DSC-W120 did very well in our December 2008 budget camera group test. (April 2009)
