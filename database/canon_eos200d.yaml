ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The Canon EOS Rebel SL2 is an ultra-compact digital SLR that features a 24MP APS-C-sized CMOS sensor, DIGIC 7 processor and Dual Pixel autofocus system. While its Dual Pixel AF system promises very good live view and video performance, the through-the-viewfinder AF system is aging. This svelte camera has a fully articulating 3" touchscreen display with an easy-to-use interface, 1080/60p video capture and a burst rate of up to 5 fps. Connectivity options include Wi-Fi (with NFC) and Bluetooth.

    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: Those seeking a portable and easy-to-use interchangeable lens camera with an optical viewfinder. Travelers who want to effortlessly share their photos with friends on social media.
        NotSoGoodFor: Those taking photos of subjects moving quickly or unpredictably. Moviemakers who want a decent set of video capture tools.
        Conclusion: The Canon EOS Rebel SL2 is an entry-level digital SLR that packs a lot of Canon's latest tech into a compact, portable body. It has solid image quality, an easy-to-use interface and good wireless connectivity. It has a mix of old and new autofocus technology, with the latter (Dual Pixel) being responsive and accurate. The SL2 is not well-suited for fast action, as it cannot keep up with moving subjects. Overall, the SL2 is not best-in-class, but you can rely on it to get the job in most situations.
