    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: Sports shooters on a budget, gadget lovers, upgraders wanting the SLR experience without a steep learning curve.
        NotSoGoodFor: Anyone else
        Conclusion: The Alpha 550 might be the most impressive Sony SLR for a long time, but for all its fancy gadgetry you can't help feeling the whole isn't as great as the sum of the parts, and it's hard to see who it's aimed at. There aren't many faster cameras in this class, but there are undoubtedly better ones.
