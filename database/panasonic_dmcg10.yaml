ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: Panasonic has released what it calls 'the world's lightest interchangeable lens camera with a viewfinder' in the shape of Lumix DMC-G10. It features the same 12.1MP Live MOS sensor and Venus Engine HD II as the DMC-G2, also announced today. It also comes with a 460K dot 3" LCD but without the tilt/swivel and touch options of the G2 and gets a lower resolution viewfinder. The G10 can record 720p HD movie in Motion JPEG format.

    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: General use either by a beginner or enthusiast using the rear LCD screen. Plenty of customisation but capable iA automatic mode as well.
        NotSoGoodFor: Anything that requires the EVF.
        Conclusion: The G10 is Panasonic's first entry-level Micro Four Thirds camera. Its core systems are capable and reliable, and although its menu system is a little dated, the G10 is an easy camera to find your way around. Unfortunately it is marred by a poor EVF, which is almost unusable in some shooting situations.
