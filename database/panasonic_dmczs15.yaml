ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: '''Little brother'' to Panasonic''s top-end ZS20 travelzoom, the more affordable 12MP ZS15 features a 16X optical zoom range that spans 24-383mm (equivalent) but lacks the built-in GPS of its more expensive sibling, along with a couple of other bells and whistles. While it doesn''t have the most Megapixels, zoom power, or features of cameras in this class, the Panasonic Lumix DMC-ZS15 is still a very good compact ultra zoom camera. It offers a nice zoom lens in a compact body, along with robust performance, very good photo quality, tons of features, and Full HD video recording. And, with an average price in the $260 range, it''s also a pretty good bargain. For those who were considering the DMC-ZS20 but were turned off by its image quality, we think the ZS15 is well worth sacrificing the 20X zoom, GPS, and 1080/60p movies for.'

    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: Travelers who want an inexpensive travel zoom that produces good photos and videos and are willing to give up the "frills" found on more expensive models.
        NotSoGoodFor: Movie enthusiasts, manual control lovers, and folks who want a camera on the bleeding edge of technology.
        Conclusion: While it doesn't have all the bells and whistles of the more expensive ZS20 (the omission of GPS being the most significant), the DMC-ZS15 produces better-looking images, while maintaining the robust performance, competitive feature set, and ease of use of its more costly sibling.
