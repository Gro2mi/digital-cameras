ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The Panasonic Lumix DMC-G5 is the ninth G-series Micro Four Thirds camera from Panasonic, and is built around a 16MP LiveMOS sensor that the company implies hasn't been used in a G-series camera before. This, combined with the company's latest 'Venus Engine' allows the capture of 1080p video at 60 frames per second (50p in European examples). It also gains an additional control lever, higher-resolution 920,000 dot rear LCD and regains the eye-sensor to automatically switch between LCD and electronic viewfinder. In principle the G5 will sit above the existing G3 in the company's lineup.
