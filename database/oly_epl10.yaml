    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: Beginners who want to stick with automatic controls and take casual video clips.
        NotSoGoodFor: Beginners looking to grow into more experienced photographers. Those who want to charge the battery on the go.
        Conclusion: The Olympus PEN E-PL10 is a compact, entry-level camera that's good at many things. It offers some beginner-friendly tools, though they don't lend themselves to growth as a photographer. Both photo and image quality are good, and the camera is responsive, but it doesn't do as much to stand out amongst its peers.
