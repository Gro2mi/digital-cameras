ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: 'Manufacturer description: The PowerShot SX710 HS digital camera features Wi-Fi and NFC connectivity with an impressive 30x Optical Zoom lens (equivalent to 25-750mm). The 20.3-Megapixel High-Sensitivity CMOS sensor and Canon’s DIGIC 6 Image Processor work together to create the Canon HS System allowing for excellent low-light performance. In addition, the camera’s Intelligent IS helps optimize image stabilization in a variety of shooting conditions whether shooting stills or video. Zoom Framing Assist helps make it easier to keep distant subjects in the field of view, even if the subject is in motion. The camera also records high-quality 1080p Full HD video at up to 60 frames per second through a dedicated movie button. Hybrid AUTO automatically recognizes the scene and optimizes camera settings to capture the high image quality for still photos while simultaneously creating a great looking highlight reel in 720p HD video.'
