ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: 'Manufacturer description: The COOLPIX A100 has an effective pixel count of 20.1 megapixels, and is equipped with a 5x optical zoom (10x when Dynamic Fine Zoom is used) NIKKOR lens that covers the wide-angle 26mm to telephoto 130mm (equivalents in 35mm format) range of focal lengths, all in an extremely portable, slim body with a depth measuring approximately 19.8mm*3 and a weight of approximately 119 g. It is a stylish model equipped with a number of features that make taking and editing photos fun. For example, Scene Auto Selector makes capturing beautiful, high-quality photos easy with the camera doing all of the work, and functions such as Glamour Retouch are easier to use with adoption of a new Creative Slider.'
