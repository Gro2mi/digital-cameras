ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The Olympus OM-D E-M1 Mark III is a high-end Micro Four Thirds camera with a 20MP sensor , in-body image stabilization with up to 7.5 stops of shake reduction and the same processor as the E-M1X. By shifting its sensor slightly, the E-M1 III can create 50MP stills, even while the camera is hand-held. Another trick the camera has is a Live ND function, while has the simulates the effects of a neutral density filter without actually needing a phsyical filter. The E-M1 III capable of shooting bursts of up to 18 fps with continuous AF and even faster with single AF. It uses the same hybrid autofocus system as the E-M1X, minus the train, car and airplane detection.The camera's magnesium alloy body is weather-sealed to IPX1 standards and has an updated dust reduction system and a shutter rated at 400k cycles. It sports a fully articulating touch LCD as well as an electronic viewfinder with a 120 fps refresh rate. The camera has two SD card slots, one of which supports UHS-II speeds. USB Power Delivery is supported, for powering the camera or charging on the go.The E-M1 III can capture DCI and UHD 4K video with support for OM-Log and 4:2:2 output over HDMI. It has both mic and headphone sockets, with the former now offering higher quality audio capture (with Olympus's LS-P4 recorder) and less white noise.

    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: Action, wildlife, nature and landscape shooters (with high-res mode). Micro Four Thirds shooters seeking the best image quality. General and travel photographers desiring a small kit.
        NotSoGoodFor: Those requiring the best dynamic range and/or resolution. Those needing reliable subject tracking.
        Conclusion: The Olympus E-M1 III is our favorite Micro Four Thirds cameras for stills shooters, as of publication. It's capable of very good image quality and jam-packed with fun and useful features. It's also no slouch when it comes to 4K video capture and offers some of the best image stabilization around. All this in a supremely well-built, comfortable, customizable and attractive body. That said being said, there are more capable, large sensor cameras available for the money.
