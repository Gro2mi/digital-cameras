ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: Sigma has totally reinvented its DP series of large sensor compacts with the DP1 Merrill. Named after Dick Merrill, inventor of the Foveon sensor, the camera  includes the most recent version of the technology - the 15x 3MP APS-C sensor first seen in Sigma's SD1. Because it features an APS-C sensor, The DP1M also features a totally redesigned lens - a 19mm F2.8 lens offering a 28mm equivalent field of view.
