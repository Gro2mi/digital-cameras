ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: Panasonic's Lumix DMC-FH7 digital compact camera features a Leica 4x zoom lens starting at 28mm and 720p HD video recording. The 16MP FH7 comes with a similar feature set to the previously released DMC-FH5 but boasts a 3" touch-sensitive LCD screen. In out tests, we found that the FH7 is a perfectly capable camera, which combines impressively hassle-free handling with impressively reliable metering and white balance systems. You shouldn't expect to make large prints but if you're just looking for a capable point-and-shoot the FH7 is definitely worth considering.

    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: Grab and social shots, and carry-everywhere photography, where a long zoom or manual control aren't necessary.
        NotSoGoodFor: Anything more critical, where the FH7's relatively low detail resolution at high ISOs, or restricted manual control, might be problematic.
        Conclusion: The Panasonic Lumix DMC-FH7 is a well-made, easy to use camera which is capable of delivering great pictures with a minimum of fuss. Image quality is very good in optimal conditions, but even when the light gets low, the FH7 can deliver acceptable results.
