ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The E-M5 is the first of Olympus' OM-D range of Micro Four Thirds cameras and is styled to look like its classic OM series SLRs. It is built around a 16MP sensor and features the company's latest 5-axis image stabilization system that works for both stills and movies. It can shoot 1080 60i movies in MOV format (h.264 compression) and includes a 1.44M dot EVF in its weather-sealed magnesium alloy body.The E-M5 is, without question, the most accomplished Micro Four Thirds camera we've yet seen and, given how well established the system has become, it vies for the title of most capable mirrorless option yet. It's not entirely without flaws, and, predictably, most of those relate to continuous autofocus. But, for the most part, the E-M5 is simply an awful lot of camera in a compact and attractive body. It's a nice camera to use and the images it takes are just as enjoyable.

    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: A wide variety of photography, particularly if you spend the time configuring it to your needs.
        NotSoGoodFor: Photography of moving subjects - the only area where it falls significantly behind a good DSLR.
        Conclusion: The Olympus OM-D E-M5 is certainly the most capable Micro Four Thirds camera we've reviewed and arguably the most likeable mirrorless model yet. It falls down a little bit on its continuous focusing but we have absolutely no complaints about the image quality. It's small, attractive, and a pleasure to use, and its pictures are equally enjoyable.
