ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The Ricoh GR Digital II succeeds the GR Digital and carries over the well-received 28mm equiv. lens from its predecessor, matching it to a new 10 megapixel sensor and new GR Engine II image processing system. For those of us with one leg longer than the other there is a new electronic leveling system and the option to shoot TLR-style square images. Performance is said to be improved with a larger buffer memory and halved RAW file-write time with the option of continuous shooting. Battery life is also said to have come on leaps and bounds with up to 370 shots now possible on a charge - the original gave up after 250.
