ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The Olympus TG-series of waterproof cameras remains a popular choice for enthusiasts looking for a rugged compact camera. The TG-4 retains lens specifications of the TG-3 with a bright 25-100mm F2.0-4.9 lens and 16MP BSI-CMOS sensor, but improves on its predecessor with the addition of Raw support, AF target selection, advanced macro features, and additional underwater modes. Wi-Fi and GPS are also built-in features, and the camera also captures air pressure, altitude, and water depth.The TG-4 is waterproof to 15m/50ft, shockproof from 2.1m/7ft, crushproof to 100kgf/220lbf, and freeze proof to -10C/+14F.A lineup of optional system accessories are available for the TG-4, including waterproof fisheye and teleconverter lenses, an LED ring light, a "sport holder", and float straps.

    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: Photographers who want a compact camera which can dive further and take an incredible beating while still producing solid image quality.
        NotSoGoodFor: Video fanatics and those who want more control over depth-of-field.
        Conclusion: The Olympus Tough TG-4 takes what made its predecessor a winner, including its build quality, fast lens (at wide-angle) and performance, and adds support for Raw shooting. By using Raw photographers can squeeze the very best image quality out of the TG-4, which makes it stand out from its JPEG-only competitions. It's not a perfect camera, though, with limited aperture choices in manual mode and unimpressive video quality.
