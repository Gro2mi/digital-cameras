ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The Canon EOS M50 is a midrange mirrorless camera with a 24MP APS-C CMOS sensor, DIGIC 8 processor and Dual Pixel AF. With select lenses it offers Dual Pixel coverage of 88% x 100% and 143 AF points, with other lenses offering 80% x 80% coverage and 99 AF points. The M50 is the first Canon camera to use the CR3 Raw format, allowing for up to 50% smaller file sizes. The M50 is capable of taking burst at 7.4 fps with continuous autofocus for up to 10 Raw or 47 JPEGs.The M50 has a fully articulating 3" touchscreen LCD with 1.04 million dots as well as an OLED electronic viewfinder with 2.36M dots. It can record 4K UHD video at 30p, albeit with a substantial crop and no Dual Pixel AF. Connectivity options include Wi-Fi and Bluetooth.

    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: People on the go who want something compact, with good connectivity and an accessible interface.
        NotSoGoodFor: Anyone interested in 4K video capture. Those without easy access to a power outlet and don't want to carry a pocket full of batteries.
        Conclusion: As a stills camera, the EOS M50 is a solid choice for photographers who want something more advanced than an entry-level camera, without going overboard. Its image quality, improved AF system and wireless connectivity are all impressive, and the new C-Raw format is a nice bonus. If 4K video is what you're after, the M50 is not the camera for you due to its high crop factor, rolling shutter and mediocre AF performance.
