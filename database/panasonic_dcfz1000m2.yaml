    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: Those looking for an all-in-one solution for travel photography and casual video capture.
        NotSoGoodFor: Those wanting to regularly shoot fast action and the highest-quality video.
        Conclusion: The FZ1000 II is a great all-around bridge camera with a good zoom lens, capable 1"-type sensor and excellent ergonomics. We appreciate the level of control and customization available, and the image quality is solid. It's not the most capable camera in its class, but it's also far from the most expensive, and is well worth a look.
