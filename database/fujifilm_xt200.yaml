ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The Fujifilm X-T200 is a low-to-midrange mirrorless camera that uses the company's X-mount. It features a 24MP APS-C CMOS sensor (non X-Trans) with on-sensor phase detection. Despite its relatively compact size, Fujifilm still found a way to give the X-T200 a fully articulating 3.5" touchscreen display, plus an electronic viewfinder. The camera can shoot bursts with continuous AF at up to 8 fps, though the buffer fills quickly. Uncropped, oversampled 4K footage can be captured at up to 30p, with a 15 minute limit. The camera has a built-in mic jack and supports headphones via an included adapter. Connectivity options include Wi-Fi and Bluetooth.

    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: Those seeking a camera with an easy-to-use touchscreen interface or who want a compact, inexpensive camera with a vast collection of great lenses.
        NotSoGoodFor: Those who want a heavily customizable camera or for whom autofocus performance is a top priority.
        Conclusion: The Fujifilm X-T200 is a camera with an attractive design, good build quality and fantastic 3.5" display. It can be operated almost entirely via the touchscreen, though it has plenty of dials if you wish to use them. Its photo and 4K video quality are very good, though 1080 quality isn't so hot. It has some nice video features, including mic and headphone sockets and a 'digital gimbal' function. The camera does has some ergonomic quirks, its autofocus is good but not great, and its battery life is average.
