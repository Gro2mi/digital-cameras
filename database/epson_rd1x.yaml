ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: Latest version of the world's first (and until recently the only) digital rangefinder, originally launched in 2004 and amazingly still in production (albeit only for sale in Japan). The new R-D1x model maintains most of the features of the previous camera including a 6Mp APS-C sensor, but adds a larger 2.5" LCD screen, support for the higher-capacity SD-HC card format and a removable handgrip. Based around a Cosina rangefinder camera with Leica M mount, the RD-1 combines classic camera styling with digital capture - and it still costs a lot less than the Leica M8.
