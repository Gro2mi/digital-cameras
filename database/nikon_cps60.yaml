ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: Slim and stylish 10 MP compact with 5x (33-165mm equiv.) zoom and huge 3.5" touch sensitive screen that fills the entire rear of the body and replaces all the external controls you'd normally operate using buttons (including the zoom). The image quality isn't bad and it's got some cool features, but the whole thing is ruined by the fiddly and unresponsive touch screen that ensures taking even the simplest snapshot is a frustrating experience.
