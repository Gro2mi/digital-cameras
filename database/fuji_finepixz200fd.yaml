ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: Stylish and fairly sophisticated ultra compact sporting a 5x (33-165mm equiv.) zoom lens behind a nifty sliding lens cover. Pity then, that the Z200fd falls short in some key areas. It's got the looks, it's got a great screen and it's got a good range of features, but there are some serious question marks over its image quality and its inability to consistently deliver acceptable results with point and shoot ease. The user interface is awful enough to put most users off ever exploring the wealth of features, the flash exposures disappointing and the color rendition less than perfect.
