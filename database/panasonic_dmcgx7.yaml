ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The Panasonic Lumix DMC-GX7 is the long-awaited successor to the DMC-GX1 mirrorless interchangeable lens camera.  New features include sensor-shift image stabilization - a first for a Lumix ILC - plus a high resolution electronic viewfinder that can tilt upward by as much as 90 degrees. The 3-inch LCD also has the ability to tilt up or down. Other additions include a faster maximum shutter speed (1/8000 sec), focus peaking, tone curve adjustment, and improved photo and video quality. Panasonic has also added Wi-Fi to the GX7, complete with NFC for easy photo sharing with mobile devices.

    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: Those seeking excellent photo and video quality with a very customizable interface; street photographers
        NotSoGoodFor: Frequent viewfinder users, video enthusiasts, those who want to process Raw images in-camera
        Conclusion: The Panasonic GX7 is a full-featured mirrorless camera that offers very good photo and video quality, a highly customizable interface, plenty of useful features, and robust performance. It's marred by a so-so viewfinder, lack of in-camera raw conversion, and a disappointing in-body IS system.
