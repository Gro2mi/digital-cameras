ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The fourth generation of Canon's hugely popular entry-level digital SLR.  In the face of increasing competiton at the budget end of the market the EOS 450D / Digital Rebel XSi aims a little higher and is a fairly significant update to its predecessor that inherits many features from the more expensive EOS 40D. It may no longer be the cheapest, but from an image quality point of view the EOS 450D sets the standard for cameras at this level, and has a comprehensive feature set that lift it above the typical 'entry level' fare.
