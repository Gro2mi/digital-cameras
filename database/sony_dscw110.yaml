ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: One of a range of very similar W series compacts announced in early 2008, the DSC-W110 is a basic but nicely put together 7.2 megapixel metal-bodied job with a useful 32-128mm (equiv.) 4x zoom and 2.5" screen. The almost identical DSC-W120 (which adds image stabilization) did very well in our December 2008 budget camera group test. (April 2009)
