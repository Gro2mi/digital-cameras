    ExecutiveSummary: Budget  mid-sized compact in the long-running and successful 'A' series of PowerShot cameras. The A480 replaces the PowerShot A470 with a more compact body and easier operation. Twenty five percent smaller than its predecessor, the A480 includes a new simplified button layout for ease of use. This entry-level compact houses a 10MP sensor, 2.5" LCD, Canon's DIGIC III processor and includes features such as Motion detection and Face Detection.(April 2009)
