ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The Ricoh Theta V is a twin-lens, candybar-shaped camera that captures 360 degree spherical images. It uses two fisheye lenses along with a two 12MP 1/2.3" sensors to capture both stills and 4K/1080 video. It has four microphones which capture directional audio and an optional microphone does an even better job. The Theta can be controlled on its own or from a smartphone. The addition of Bluetooth LE allows for near-instant re-pairing of camera and mobile device. The Theta V can also livestream high bit rate 4K or 2K video via a USB connection to a PC.
