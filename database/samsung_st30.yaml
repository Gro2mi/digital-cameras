ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: Samsung ST30 ultra-compact is a 10.1MP camera offering 3x zoom starting at a usefully wide 28mm equivalent focal length. The camera is, the company says, around the size of an average mobile phone, giving a good idea of who the camera is aimed at. It has all the standard features such as Smart Auto mode and Perfect Portrait mode you'd expect in the budget sector.
