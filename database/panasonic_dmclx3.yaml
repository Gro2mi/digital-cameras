ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: Third generation of Panasonic's compact enthusiast model is a true thoroughbred offering a fast zoom with a real wideangle, a superb screen and excellent image quality, including high ISO performance puts most competitors to shame. The LX3 is positively understated compared to some of its competitors, which loudly proclaim the 'bigger is better' rather than 'less is more', and it's a far, far better camera for it. It's small enough to carry anywhere, fast and subtle enough for street photography and good enough to produce a decent 8x10 without the need to use raw. Of course it's not perfect; the controls are pretty fiddly (as it's so small) and there's no telephoto to speak of, but if the feature set matches your needs there's little to match it.
