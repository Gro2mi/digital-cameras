ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: Canon's young SX range gets a serious facelift in the SX200 IS, which goes head to head with Panasonic's TZ models in the increasingly crowded  'big zoom/small camera' sector. Much more of a premium model than previous SX cameras, , the 12.1 MP sensor and 12x zoom (with a 28mm equiv. wide-angle) are wrapped up in a quality metal body and, in the SX200 IS offers more photographic control than most competitors. Image quality in good light is impressive, but in lower light at higher ISO settings it's slightly below par, and the new user interface is a step backwards in our opinion, making the high price  hard to justify.
