ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The GR is the spiritual successor to the GR Digital series and features a 16MP APS-C sensor behind its 28mm equivalent, F2.8 lens. It's the first product to show signs of post-merger integration at Pentax-Ricoh, gaining the Pentax TAv exposure mode but retaining a host of traditional Ricoh features.The Ricoh GR retains its predecessor's excellent and customizable user interface, making it a pleasure to use as a pocketable wide-angle photographers' camera. The JPEGs are occasionally a little muted but the Raw files, feature set and lens quality mean it's capable of outstanding results.
