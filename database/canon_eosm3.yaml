    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: Those seeking a well-built, compact ILC for studio and landscape photography. People who wish to adapt non-native lenses to a modern camera.
        NotSoGoodFor: Photographers hoping to capture photos of kids and fast action. Those who want to shoot all day without carrying spare batteries.
        Conclusion: With so many great mirrorless cameras on the market, the EOS M3 just isn't competitive. While it's well-designed and easy-to-use, important features like autofocus and battery life disappoint. For scenery and portraits it'll do the job, but if your subject is in-motion there are better choices.
