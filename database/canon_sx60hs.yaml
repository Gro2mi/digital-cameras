ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The PowerShot SX60 HS has a gigantic 65X optical zoom lens. equivalent to 21-1365mm (naturally, it has image stabilization). It features as 16.1 CMOS sensor as well as Canon's latest DIGIC 6 image processor, allowing for 6.4 fps continuous shooting, 1080/60p video, and a max ISO of 3200 (at full resolution). It has a fully articulating 3" LCD as well as an electronic viewfinder. The Zoom Framing Assist feature lets photographers 'back out' and locate their subject before zooming back in. This feature also allows one to lock onto the full body, upper body, or face, and automatically move the lens back (toward wide-angle) as the subject moves closer or further from the camera. As with most recent PowerShots, Wi-Fi is built in, with photo sharing via Canon's Image Gateway service.

    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: Photographers who want a reliable long zoom camera with advanced still and video features. Those who want to fine-tune image quality with Raw files.
        NotSoGoodFor: Low light shooters and those on a budget.
        Conclusion: The Canon PowerShot SX60 HS is the 'safe bet' in the superzoom category. It offers good image quality, a fully articulating LCD, more than enough zoom power, and a solid feature set that includes Raw support, advanced video functionality, and a hot shoe. Downsides include a not-so-great electronic viewfinder, a slow maximum aperture range, and limited camera control from a smartphone.
