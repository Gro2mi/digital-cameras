ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: Fujifilm's JV series are intended to appeal to style - as well as budget - conscious photographers, and Heading up the JV series is the JV200. Available in five colors (varying by territory) the metal-bodied JV200 certainly cuts a dash that belies its low pricepoint. As far as specification is concerned, the 12MP JV200 matches its near-neighbors the JV100 and JV150 in most respects, but trumps them by offering a 3x optical zoom, with a meaningful wideangle setting of 28mm (equivalent).
