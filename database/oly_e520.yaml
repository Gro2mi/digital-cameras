ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: Refresh to the E-510 improves autofocus in live view mode and throws in a handful of minor enhancements. With a superb feature set (including in-body image stabilization) and customization options that set it apart from most of its competitors the E-520 looks very competitive on paper, but the viewfinder and image quality (particularly in challenging shooting conditions) are far from class-leading and taken as a whole the camera struggles to stand out from the crowd. Recent price cuts have made the E-520 seem a lot more attractive, and the results in good light are impressive at normal print sizes, with pleasing color and very well optimised JPEGs - and an excellent kit lens.
