ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The S9100 compact superzoom offers a 25mm wide-angle to 450mm telephoto coverage and is one amongst the first Coolpix cameras to feature a Nikkor ED glass lens. Big on features it offers 1080p HD video recording, HD output, 360/180 degrees panorama modes and a creative slider to adjust images while shooting. Night Portrait and Night Landscape scene modes make it easier to photographs at night with the combination of a 12MP back illuminated CMOS sensor that is designed for  better low-light photography. The S9100 is notable for its greatly improved image quality compared to the S8000, and unusually consistent optical quality, which remains high all the way from 25-450mm (equivalent). Perhaps more importantly, the S9100's Hybrid VR mode does an excellent job of delivering sharp images, even at 450mm (equivalent). The only major weak point of the S9100 is its lack of meaningful exposure control compared to most of its travel zoom competitors. On the plus side, its automatic modes work very well, and of course exposure compensation is on hand if the camera's metering system doesn't quite give the results that you want.

    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: 25-450mm (equivalent) lens is great for travelling
        NotSoGoodFor: Anything that requires manual exposure control
        Conclusion: The S9100 is streets ahead from its predecessor the S8000, thanks to a new sensor and much more versatile zoom lens. Image quality is very good in daylight conditions, and HD video footage looks great. The S9100 is also one of the fastest and most responsive cameras in its class. The only major negative points are sub-par image quality in poor light at high ISO settings and very little manual exposure control.
