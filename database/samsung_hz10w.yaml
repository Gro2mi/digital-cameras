ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: Well specified compact with a versatile 24-240mm (equiv.) 10x zoom range, HD movie capture and a wealth of features. The HZ10W(WB500 in Europe) is Samsung's first stab at the compact superzoom segment, and while the Korean manufacturer got many things right there is also some room for improvement. It's speedy, has an excellent user interface and reliable exposure, but is let down a little by image quality and low light performance issues.
