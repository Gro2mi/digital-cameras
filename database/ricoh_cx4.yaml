ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The Ricoh CX4 CX4 is a compact superzoom with a 10 megapixel back-illuminated CMOS sensor. It offers the same 10.7x (28-300mm equiv.) zoom lens, 920k dot 3 inch LCD and 720p HD video recording as the company's CX3, but with enhanced image stabilization. The company says its latest version reduces blur to a degree equivalent to using a shutter speed 3.7 EV faster than actually being used. Other features include subject-tracking AF and additional shooting modes.
