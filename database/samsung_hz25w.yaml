    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: Photographers who want an intuitive user interface and long zoom in a small package
        NotSoGoodFor: Low light shooting, anything that requires snappy operation and/or reliable Auto WB
        Conclusion: The Samsung is another model that offers a lot of zoom in a tiny package but in low light it cannot quite keep up with the best cameras in this class. It's also not the quickest and its focus can struggle in dim conditions.
