ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The Fujifilm GFX 100S is a 102MP medium format camera with an image stabilized BSI-CMOS sensor. This image stabilization is rated at up to 6.0 stops, and can work in sync with in-lens stabilization to maintain this performance. It has a hybrid autofocus system with nearly 100% coverage and a multi-shot mode for capturing 400MP images of static subjects. It shoot a DCI or UHD 4K video with internal capture at up to 400Mbps or a choice of 10-bit 4:2:2 or 12-bit Raw output over HDMI. The compact body is weather-sealed, has an OLED info displays on the top, and a fixed 3.69M-dot OLED viewfinder. Its dual-hinged 3.2" LCD can tilt for both landscape and portrait photography.

    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: Landscapes, portraiture, studio work
        NotSoGoodFor: Fast-paced action and scenarios that require rapid responses
        Conclusion: The Fujifilm GFX 100S is the smallest, least expensive way to achieve image quality beyond what full-frame can currently offer. You lose some responsiveness and flexibility in return for that, but as an image-making tool the GFX is excellent. It's also a surprisingly capable video camera but its smaller battery risks being more limiting than it is for stills shooting. Impressive in the studio and beyond.
