    ExecutiveSummary: 'Manufacturer description: The Samsung NX30 is a midrange mirrorless camera that features a 20.3MP CMOS sensor and the company''s latest DRIMeIV processor. It supports the same NX-mount lenses as its predecessor (the NX20). The NX30 has a Hybrid AF system that combines on-chip phase detection with more traditional contrast detection. Photos can be composed on a fully articulating 3-inch AMOLED display or a unique pull-out, tilting electronic viewfinder. The NX30 has numerous Wi-Fi functions, and now includes NFC for ''tap and go'' photo sharing.'

    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: Beginners wanting a DSLR-like experience, those who want to share photos wirelessly, landscape and travel shooters
        NotSoGoodFor: Tracking fast action, very low light, would-be videographers
        Conclusion: The Samsung NX30 provides a DSLR-like experience in a mirrorless camera, with the very un-DSLR-like provision of great live view performance. Its built-in EVF, high-resolution APS-C sensor and connectivity features are very useful, and though we don't feel it's a class-leader in any particular way, the NX30 provides a nice option for those who want the ergonomics of a DSLR and the modern touches of a mirrorless camera.
