ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: 'Manufacturer description: The Nikon Df is a unique, advanced-level D-SLR that harmonizes Nikon heritage and modern performance in a lightweight and very capable FX-format camera. The new Df pays homage to the enduring style and controls of Nikon’s distinguished “F” series of 35mm film cameras, yet features technology similar to Nikon’s professional flagship D4 D-SLR.'

    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: Anyone longing to shoot using traditional control dials. Owners of Pre-AI Nikon lenses.
        NotSoGoodFor: Users of autofocus wishing to work in low light. Photographers looking for the best available technology for their money.
        Conclusion: The Nikon Df isn't for everyone. This is a product that's as much about invoking nostalgia as it is about capturing the moment. Its control setup is slower than a modern DSLR, but should appeal to those photographers who want a camera that feels more like a camera than an electronic device, and its 16MP imaging sensor is excellent.
