    ExecutiveSummary: 'Manufacturer description: The RICOH WG-M1 is WiFi enabled, waterproof to an impressive depth of 32 feet without requiring a  protective housing, shock-resistant against a fall from 6 feet, and cold-resistant to temperatures as low as -10°C. With its ultra-wide-angle lens, this extraordinary camera captures dynamic Full HD movies with a realistic sense of depth. Approximately 14.0 effective megapixels captures vibrant, high-resolution still images, while its high-speed, continuous shooting capability records subjects at a speed of roughly 10 images per second. Combining the WG-M1 with an array of newly introduced camera-mount accessories opens many options and creative solutions in capturing adventure-packed images and movies.'
