ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The PowerShot G7 X Mark II is an update to the original G7X. The camera's 20.2MP 1 inch BSI-CMOS sensor is paired with Canon's latest DIGIC 7 image processor, and offers an ISO range of 125-12800. The lens has a fast maximum aperture range of F1.8-2.8 and equivalent focal range of 24-100mm. It has a 9-blade curved aperture diagram as well as an ND filter.  The G7 X II has a compact metal body with a control dial around the lens, a dedicated exposure comp dial on the top, and the usual rear dial on the rear. The 3" touchscreen LCD can be flipped up by 180 degrees and down 45 degrees.

    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: Travelers seeking a pocketable camera that performs well in low light and offers good control over depth-of-field.
        NotSoGoodFor: Peak action and sports photography. Those hoping to get a full day of shooting day with a single battery.
        Conclusion: The Canon PowerShot G7 X Mark II is a well-designed enthusiast compact that's a pleasure to use. It offers a versatile focal range, very good image quality, a large buffer for continuous shooting and 1080/60p video capture. Sharpening and noise reduction in JPEGs are heavy-handed, and battery life still needs work, but aside from those issues Canon has done an impressive job with the second iteration of the G7 X.
