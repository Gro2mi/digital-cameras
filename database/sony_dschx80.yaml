ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The Cyber-shot DSC-HX80 is a compact travel zoom camera with a unique pop-up electronic viewfinder, similar to Sony's RX100 III and IV as well as the Cyber-shot DSC-HX90V. It sports a 18.2MP BSI CMOS sensor along with a 30x optical zoom lens (24-720mm equivalent). It has a 5-axis image stabilization system. In addition to the pop-up EVF there's also a tilting LCD with 921k dots. The HX80 also has manual exposure control (but no Raw support), 1080/60p video capture and, of course, Wi-Fi with NFC.
