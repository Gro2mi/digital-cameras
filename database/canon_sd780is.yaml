ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The slimmest Digital Ixus (Elph) yet is certainly very pocket friendly (18.4mm thick) and has heaps of style, but as a camera it's fairly run of the mill; 3x optical zoom (33-100mm equiv.), point and shoot ease of use and a 2.5" screen are joined by HD (720p) movie capture and Canon's latest DIGIC 4-powered gadgets, but essentially this is a frill-free 12 megapixel camera wrapped in a luxurious, ultra compact steel body.
