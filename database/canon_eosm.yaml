ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The Canon EOS M is the company's first mirrorless interchangeable lens camera. Based around the same 18MP APS-C sensor as the EOS 650D/T4i, the EOS M is the first model to use a new, smaller 'EF-M' lens mount. As we've seen before in the mirrorless sector, the EOS M is predominantly aimed at the point-and-shoot upgrader market looking for DSLR quality and makes greater use of a 650D-style touch-screen interface.
