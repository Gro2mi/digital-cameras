ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The X-E1 is in essence a slimmed-down X-Pro1, with the large, complex and expensive hybrid finder replaced by a purely-electronic viewfinder. Not any old EVF though - it uses a 2.36M dot OLED unit, out-speccing the X-Pro1's 1.44M dot LCD finder. In return its rear screen is slightly downgraded in terms of both size and resolution, to a still-respectable 2.8" 460k dot LCD - according to Fujifilm this is necessary to keep the camera's size down. The result is a compact body that's broadly similar in size to both the much-loved FinePix X100, and its most obvious competitors like the E-M5 and NEX-7.The X-E1 gets a few new features relative to the X-Pro1, commensurate with its class. Notably, there's a little built-in pop-up flash, a 2.5mm stereo microphone socket for movie recording, and the ability to use an electronic shutter release cable.

    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: Any application requiring critical image quality - the X-E1 turns out excellent pictures.
        NotSoGoodFor: Movie mode and fast action shooting, where the camera's limitations do get in the way of results.
        Conclusion: The Fujifilm X-E1 is a fine camera, and a pleasure to use. Fujifilm's recent improvements to focusing, both manual and automatic, make a real difference to performance, the built-in EVF is excellent, and the enthusiast-friendly ergonomics are addictive. The only serious issue is the camera's video mode, which is sub-par, compared to the competition.
