ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The Sony a7R IV is the company's fourth generation, high-resolution full-frame mirrorless camera and is built around a BSI-CMOS sensor that outputs 60.2MP images. The "A" variant of the a7R IV is the same as the original model, but with a higher resolution (2.36M-dot) LCD.Despite its high resolution, it can shoot at up to 10 frames per second with full autofocus and shoot 4K video either from the full width of its sensor or from an APS-C/Super 35 crop. It also gains a 16-shot high-resolution mode that can be used to generate 240MP images of static scenes.The a7R IV has in-body image stabilization that's usable for still and video shooting. It has a top-notch autofocus system with face and eye detection that sticks to the subject, even if they look away or are momentarily blocked. It has a large, ultra-high-res electronic viewfinder, tilting touchscreen display and dual UHS-II SD card slots. The camera body is sealed against dust and moisture.
