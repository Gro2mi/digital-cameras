ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The Nikon Coolpix P310 is built around a 16.1MP BSI-CMOS sensor and features a 4.2x optical zoom lens spanning 24-100mm equivalent with a fast F1.8 maximum aperture. Full 1080 HD video recording is available, and a sharp, high-resolution 3.0 inch LCD with 921,000 is provided. Burst shooting at up to 7 frames per second is possible for up to 5 frames, and the P310 offers PASM exposure modes to please beginners and advanced shooters alike. It's a JPEG-only camera unlike some of its Raw-capable competitors in the advanced compact category. It's also less costly, offering a point-and-shoot user stepping up from a basic model great ergonomics, advanced features and pocketability. Recently replaced by the altogether more capable P330 (which notably offers raw capture) the P310 remains capable and responsive camera.

    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: Photographers that want control over exposure and operation in a portable, affordable body, but don't mind JPEG-only shooting
        NotSoGoodFor: Anyone that wants to go that little step further in terms of image quality
        Conclusion: The Nikon Coolpix P310 is a hard camera to categorize, offering the sort of manual control and customization options that we'd associate with more expensive models, but with a small sensor and no Raw shooting option. Ultimately, it's a good-looking, pocketable camera that has a lot to offer, but falls short of its (more expensive) high-end rivals when it comes to critical image quality.
