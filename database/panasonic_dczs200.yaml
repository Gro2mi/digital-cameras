    ExecutiveSummary: Panasonic's ZS200/TZ200 is a 20MP 1"-sensor compact that updates the existing ZS100 and its 25-250mm equiv. zoom with a 24-360mm equiv. F3.3-6.4 lens that's both slightly wider and much longer (though a bit slower). Like its predecessor the ZS200 offers a 3" touchscreen, accompanied by an upgraded 2.3 million-dot EVF with 0.53x magnification. Contrast detect autofocus is aided by Panasonic's very good Depth from Defocus technology, and up to 10 fps burst shooting is available with AF-S (6 fps in AF-C). Rounding out a travel-friendly feature set are 4K video, Wi-Fi with Bluetooth, 5-axis image stabilization and a new L.Monochrome Photo Style for a black-and-white film look.

    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: Travelers who want a telephoto lens in a small package, and to be able to share photos quickly and easily.
        NotSoGoodFor: Those who wish to capture video at wide-angles. Sports, portrait or low light shooters. Those sensitive to field sequential EVFs.
        Conclusion: The Panasonic Lumix DC-ZS200/TZ100 packs a 24-360mm equiv. lens into a body that fill fit into all but the skinniest pockets. Its time-tested sensor produces high quality photos, its autofocus system is snappy, 4K video generally good and battery life strong. However, there is a 1.5X crop in 4K video that also increases noise, a lens that tends to be soft, and an EVF that some may find bothersome. For those who want a long lens, compact body and 1" sensor, the ZS200 is one of the better choices out there.
