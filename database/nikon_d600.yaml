ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The Nikon D600 is the smallest, least expensive full frame Nikon DSLR yet, aimed directly at enthusiast photographers. It is built around a 24MP FX format CMOS sensor and crams many of the features of the more expensive D800 into a distinctly D7000-esque body. It features a 100% coverage viewfinder and 39-point autofocus system, nine of which are cross-type points. It can capture 1080p HD video at 30, 25 or 24 frames per second and can stream uncompressed footage out over its HDMI port.

    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: Full frame shooters looking for a smaller, lighter and less expensive alternative to pro-level DSLRs. Photographers who often shoot at high ISOs.
        NotSoGoodFor: Sports shooters who need wider AF coverage or videographers who demand real-time aperture control and fullscreen HDMI output.
        Conclusion: The Nikon D600 brings full frame functionality to the masses, along with dual SD card slots and 100% viewfinder coverage. Image quality at high ISO sensitivities is outstanding, and a wealth of customization options enables quick access to shooting controls.
