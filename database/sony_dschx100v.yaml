    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: Shooters looking for a DSLR-like handling experience with an EVF and a wide zoom range.
        NotSoGoodFor: More experienced shooters who like to tweak settings between each shot. Those who prefer a small pocketable camera.
        Conclusion: The HX100V combines abundant external control points, DSLR-style ergonomic handling and an extremely versatile 30x zoom range. Image quality is better than average for a compact-sized sensor. Unfortunately, the camera's slow startup time and sluggish operational response can lead to missed photo opportunities.
