ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: Budget  mid-sized compact in the long-running and successful 'A' series of PowerShot cameras. The A580 has a solid feature set for a camera at this level (including a useful 35-140mm equiv. 4x zoom) but we'd recommend paying a little more and moving up to the A590 IS, which throws image stabilization and comprehensive photographic controls into the mix.(April 2009)
