ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: 'Manufacturer description: The innovative a7S camera features a newly developed, 12.2 effective megapixel 35mm CMOS sensor paired with a powerful BIONZ X image processor, allowing it to shoot at a sensitivity range of ISO 50 – 409600 with unprecedented dynamic range and low noise.The new model is also the world''s first camera to utilize the entire width of a full-frame image sensor in 4K video acquisition, and does this without cropping or line skipping as it can read and process data from every one of the sensor''s pixels. This allows 4K video shooters to utilize all of the artistic and creative benefits provided by the unique sensor.The camera is also equipped with the same high-precision Fast Intelligent AF system as the a7R camera, with drastically improved low-light AF sensitivity that can go as low as -4EV.'

    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: Professional video shooters, photographers that value high ISO sensitivity
        NotSoGoodFor: Landscape photographers, shooters needing the highest resolution images available
        Conclusion: Its 1080p footage is the cleanest, most detailed we've yet seen, with virtually no moiré and often jaw-dropping low-light performance. Some of the low light advantage is undercut if you need to stop-down to achieve sufficient depth-of-field but, unlike smaller sensor systems, you have the choice over whether to do this or whether to embrace the shallow-depth-of-field and low light capabilities.
