ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: 'Manufacturer description: The COOLPIX B500 is an ergonomically designed zoom camera powered by AA batteries for added convenience. A 16-megapixel BSI CMOS sensor alongside an impressive 40x optical zoom NIKKOR glass lens (up to 80x with Dynamic Fine Zoom), lets users capture high quality images from near or far. The camera also offers hybrid VR to combat camera shake when shooting on-the-go. To complement still images captured, the B500 can record full 1080p HD video, while framing every shot is made easy using the high resolution tilting 920k-dot 3-inch LCD screen that helps capture images at any angle. Users can easily upload their creations to social media via Nikon SnapBridge using any compatible smartphone or tablet.'
