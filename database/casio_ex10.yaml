ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The Casio EX-10 enthusiast compact camera features a 12MP 1/1.7" back-illuminated CMOS sensor and 3.5-inch touchscreen display that rotates upward by 180 degrees. The EX-10 features the same 28-112mm equivalent F1.8-2.5 lens as the Olympus XZ-2 and Pentax MX-1. The camera has a dial around the lens whose function can be customized. You'll find not one, but two shutter release buttons, one of which (on the front) can function differently than the main one.  It also offers a 'dual-combination bracket function', which varies a pair of shooting parameters over three shots, resulting in a total of nine images.
