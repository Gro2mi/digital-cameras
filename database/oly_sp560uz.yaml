ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: Second generation 18x zoom camera from Olympus offers a compelling specification mix (including 27-486mm lens range, full photographic control and raw mode) and a list of features as long as your arm. Obviously squeezing so much lens into a small package means compromises in image quality, and in low light (at high ISO settings) the results leave much to be desired. The SP-570UZ's biggest problem, however, is that there are better - and cheaper - competitors out there.
