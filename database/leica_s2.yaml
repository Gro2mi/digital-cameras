ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The monsterous Leica S2 is built around a massive 37.5 megapixel 30x45mm sensor (56% larger than 'full frame'), that puts it squarely into the medium format sector. Sensitivity runs from ISO 80 to 1250 and the camera can shoot 1.5 fps for up to 8 RAW DNG files. On the back you'll find a three inch LCD with 460,000 dots and everything else is pretty much to be expected; focussing is automatic, the S2 boasts three metering modes, four exposure modes, an integral metal shutter which provides 32 to 1/4000 sec and a flash sync of 1/125 sec (optional lens leaf shutter delivers flash sync up to 1/500 sec). Customers willing to spend an extra $5,000/£3,096 will receive an S2-P featuring a sapphire glass monitor screen and 'Platinum Service' support package.
