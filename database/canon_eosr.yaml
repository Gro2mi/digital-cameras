ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The EOS R is Canon's first full-frame mirrorless camera. It features a 30.3MP CMOS sensor with Dual Pixel AF and an ISO range of 100-40000 (expandable to 50-102400). The EOS R can record both 14-bit (CRW) and compressed (C-RAW) formats. It can shoot continuously at 8 fps in single AF and 5 fps with continuous AF. The Dual Pixel AF system has a whopping 5655 selectable AF points and it can function at light levels as low as -6EV.The compact body has a 3.69M-dot OLED electronic viewfinder with a 0.76x magnification, as well as a 3.2", 2.1M-dot fully-articulating touchscreen LCD. On the top plate is an OLED panel that displays current shooting information. The EOS R offers Mini-HDMI and USB-C ports, as well as a 3.5mm external mic socket. Battery life is CIPA-rated at 370 shots per charge (450 using Power Saving mode). A battery grip is available. The EOS R has a single memory card slot that supports UHS-II media.4K UHD video can be captured at up to 29.97 fps using ALL-I or IBP compression with a max bit rate of 480MBps. If you want 60p video you'll have to drop down to Full HD.

    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: General and social photography, casual video shooters and those looking for either a backup body for their full-frame Canon glass or are looking at building up a collection of new RF lenses.
        NotSoGoodFor: Those looking to shoot sports or fast-moving subjects, those needing the absolute best image quality for either landscape or video work.
        Conclusion: With a 30MP sensor, fantastic color reproduction and on-sensor autofocus, the EOS R can produce some beautiful photographs with pinpoint-accurate focus. But it's Canon's first mirrorless full-frame camera, and in many ways, it shows. The ergonomics feel unfinished, and for the same or less money, you can find better video, more dynamic range and faster burst speeds elsewhere. But we have to admit that Canon's new RF lenses are simply spectacular, and at this time, the EOS R is the only way to get to use them.
