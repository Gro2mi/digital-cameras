ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The Fujifilm FinePix F600 EXR is an updated version of the F550 Raw-capable compact superzoom. The F600 features the same back-illuminated 1/2" EXR CMOS sensor and 24-360mm equivalent zoom lens but gains a series of feature improvements, allowing users to make more of the camera's capabilities. The biggest advance is a motion detection mode that allows the camera to increase the ISO to better capture moving subjects. If motion isn't detected, the camera will use a lower ISO to maximise image quality. The camera's GPS is also better utilized, with the addition of a Landmark Navigator mode that informs you of nearby landmarks as well as tagging them in your photos. It also features an 'Intelligent Digital Zoom' context-sensitive sharpening feature when up-sizing the cropped images shot in digital zoom mode, to reduce the loss of image quality. The camera retains the F550's Raw capability and 1080p30 HD movie shooting.
