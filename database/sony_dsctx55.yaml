ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The Sony TX55 touch-screen card-style camera. The 16.2MP camera features a backside illuminated CMOS sensor and stabilized 5x zoom lens. The TX55 can capture 1080i60 movies and store them on the MicroSD/SDHC or Memory Stick Micro cards it uses to keep the body size down to an impressively slim 12.2mm deep. Beyond this it has a 3.3" OLED touch screen, features such as 3D Sweep Panorama and gains the 'Picture Effects' image processing filters that debuted in the NEX C3. It also uses a 'Super Pixel Resolution' digital zoom mode that applies image processing to try enhance the image back up to full pixel-count.
