ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The Nikon Z 7 is the company's high-end full-frame mirrorless camera. It features a 45.7MP BSI-CMOS sensor, a hybrid AF system with 493 points and 90% coverage and 5-axis in-body image stabilization. The rugged body is similar in design to the D850 DSLR and is fully sealed against dust and moisture. It features a 3.68M-dot electronic viewfinder and tilting 3.2", 2.1M-dot touchscreen LCD. An OLED panel on the top plate displays current shooting settings. Photos are stored on an XQD card.The Z 7 can shoot continuously at 9 fps with AE locked and 5.5 fps with continuous AF/AE. The buffer is relatively small, topping out at 18-23 Raw and 25 JPEG images. It can capture 4K video using the full width of the sensor, or users can switch to a DX crop mode where the entire sensor is sampled. You can use the same features for videos as you can for stills, including 5-axis IS and the hybrid AF system (with 435 points here). The Z 7 supports focus peaking, zebra patterns, time code and 10-bit Log output over HDMI. The camera can record 8-bit video internally and externally at the same time. Connectivity options include Wi-Fi (802.11ac) with Bluetooth as well as the ability to connect directly to a PC.

    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: Hybrid stills and video shooters, photographers looking for a versatile tool for a wide range of subjects in a compact package.
        NotSoGoodFor: Those needing class-leading autofocus performance, faster burst rates, or greater buffer depth.
        Conclusion: The Nikon Z7 is an extremely well-rounded digital camera and suitable for a wide range of photographic and video needs. It packs outstanding image quality and very good 4K video in a lightweight, well-built package with in-body image stabilization. Autofocus is less reliable than the competition and the buffer can be limiting for fast action, but overall, the Z7 is a pleasure to shoot with.
