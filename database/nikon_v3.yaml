ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: Nikon's 1 V3 is the newest model in the company's enthusiast mirrorless interchangeable lens camera system. The body features external controls and programmable custom buttons for easy manual adjustments, and is kitted with a removable hand grip (GR-N1010) and electronic viewfinder (DF-N1000). The V3 is built around an 18.4 MP CX-format sensor, and uses a hybrid contrast (171 points) and phase detect (105 points) AF system. The V3 boasts a continuous shooting speed that outpaces DSLRs at 20 fps with full autofocus. The camera is also capable of 1080/60p Full HD video, includes built-in Wi-Fi connectivity, and a new touch-panel tilting LCD display.

    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: Fast action such as wildlife and sports. Street photographers will find the the V3's silent mode useful.
        NotSoGoodFor: Low-light or landscape photography where absolute image quality or dynamic range is needed.
        Conclusion: The Nikon 1 V3 is one of the few mirrorless cameras we'd recommend for shooting sports or quickly moving kids. It brings high autofocus performance, interchangeable-lens versatility, and DSLR-like handling in a portable size. However, when factoring in price, there are many other good, less expensive alternatives with better image quality and all-around value.
