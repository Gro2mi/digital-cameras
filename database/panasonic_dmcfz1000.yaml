    ExecutiveSummary: The Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ1000 is a superzoom camera that features a 1"-type, 20.1 megapixel CMOS sensor along with an F2.8-4.0 25-400mm lens. The lens uses Depth from Defocus technology, which allows extremely fast autofocus speeds, according to Panasonic. The FZ1000 is powered by the same quad-core Venus Engine processor used by the DMC-GH4, which not only allows for fast performance, but also 4K video recording at 30fps. Photos can be composed on a 3" fully articulating 921k dot or an OLED electronic viewfinder with 2.4 million dots. The FZ1000 also has built-in Wi-Fi with NFC for easy photo sharing via your smartphone.

    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: Travelers who want great photo quality and a powerful, fast lens. Video enthusiasts who want to be on the cutting edge.
        NotSoGoodFor: Those desiring a big zoom in a smaller package. Advanced videographers desiring Auto ISO and headphone output.
        Conclusion: The Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ1000 is a very impressive superzoom camera with an F2.8-4, 25-400mm lens and a one-inch sensor. Both photo and video quality are impressive, and support for 4K videos make the camera futureproof. The FZ1000 has a beautiful XGA EVF and a fully articulating LCD. Handling and build quality aren't perfect, but the camera's features make up for it.
