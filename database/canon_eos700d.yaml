ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The EOS 700D/ Rebel T5i is essentially unchanged compared to its predecessor, sporting an 18MP APS-C Hybrid CMOS sensor with built-in phase detection autofocus, a DIGIC 5 processor, a 9-point cross-type AF system, and Full HD movie mode. Differences are limited to live preview of Creative Filters, a new mode dial that turns 360 degrees, a new body finish and a new 18-55mm STM lens to better serve Hybrid AF in movie mode.The Canon EOS 700D / Rebel T5i is an upgrade to the 650D almost in name only, but still combines very good image quality with a comprehensive, well-designed touchscreen interface. AF performance in live view mode and video is an improvement over early Rebel DSLRs, but still lags behind mirrorless options.

    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: Enthusiasts looking for the manual control and image quality of a DSLR but who'd appreciate the option to use a touchscreen interface.
        NotSoGoodFor: Users who require fast AF performance in live view and/or video mode.
        Conclusion: The Canon EOS 700D / Rebel T5i is an upgrade to the 650D almost in name only, but still combines very good image quality with a comprehensive, well-designed touchscreen interface. AF performance in live view mode and video is an improvement over early Rebel DSLRs, but still lags behind mirrorless options.
