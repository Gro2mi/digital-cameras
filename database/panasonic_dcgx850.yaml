ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The Panasonic DC-GX850 (GX800, GF9) is the result of Panasonic combining the 'beauty'-oriented GF line of interchangeable lens cameras with the ultra-compact-oriented GM line. The camera sports a 16MP Live MOS Four Thirds sensor, with no optical low-pass filter. It uses Panasonic's latest Venus engine and is capable of a 5 fps burst with continuous AF and offers Panasonic's Depth From Defocus AF.  A touch-sensitive 3-inch 1.04M-dot tilting monitor can be flipped up 180-degrees for selfies and a variety of modes and functions are available to aide the selfie-obsessed. It can capture 4K/UHD (30p/24p) video; a 4K Photo function allows for 8MP still extraction from video while Post Focus and Focus Stacking allow users to select what area(s) they want in focus. Built-in Wi-Fi allows for easy transfer of images to ones devices as well as remote shooting capabilities.

    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: Casual and beginner photographers looking for an easy-to-use camera that they can slip in a bag or purse.
        NotSoGoodFor: Enthusiast users, who will eventually hit the camera's limitations. Dedicated video shooters craving exposure control.
        Conclusion: The Panasonic GX850 is one of the smallest/lightest interchangeable lens cameras on the market and reasonably simple to operate. It features a 180-degree flip-up touchscreen, excellent stills and video quality and reliable autofocus. It is also one of the only camera in its class to offer 4K video capture.
