ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The Samsung WB750 is a compact superzoom with an 18x zoom lens. The camera is built around what the company says is a proprietary 12.5MP back-illuminated CMOS sensor. Despite its slim dimensions, the camera offers a 24-432mm equivalent zoom range with its F3.2-5.8 image stabilized lens. As well as being able to shoot 10 full-resolution frames per second, it can also capture 1080p30 HD video.
