    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: Smartphone upgraders looking for a step up in image quality from a pocketable camera
        NotSoGoodFor: Enthusiasts who enjoy taking manual control
        Conclusion: The Samsung NX mini is an impressive camera purely because of the amount of technology that Samsung has managed to place inside such a tiny body. The system may be small (no pun intended) for now but the lenses currently available for the mini are of a high quality, and the camera is capable of excellent results from its 1in sensor. Ultimately, our frustrations with the mini are almost all focused around its user interface, which needs some work before it will appeal to enthusiasts. Right now the mini is a great point-and-shoot with some slightly awkward manual controls but it has the potential to be much more.
