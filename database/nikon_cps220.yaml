ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: Another affordable and very compact all-metal Coolpix from Nikon's 'S' range. The S220 replaces the Coolpix S210, which scored well in our December 08 group test, upping the resolution to 10MP and throwing in a couple of Nikon's latest gadgets (Smile Mode, Blink Detection etc) but otherwise changing little. And that's no bad thing; the S210 was a suprisingly capable ultra slim compact at a bargain price. A far better choice than the S230 (same camera with a 3.0" touch screen that's high on novelty but low on utility).
