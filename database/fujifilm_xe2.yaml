    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: Most types of photography, whether you're looking to capture Raw or JPEG images.
        NotSoGoodFor: Movie shooting, sports or action photography.
        Conclusion: The X-E2 is a highly capable enthusiast-focused camera capable of producing excellent images. Direct control dials and plenty of customization make for an engaging shooting experience, and its output is impressive. Wi-Fi and in-camera raw conversion make it easy to share images. It's only the lackluster video that disappoints.
