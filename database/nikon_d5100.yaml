ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The D5100 sits comfortably in the middle of Nikon's non-Pro DSLR lineup, carefully blending the features of the beginner-friendly D3100 with the image capabilities of the more expensive D7000. As such it features a 16.2MP CMOS sensor, 1080p (H.264) movie capability and an articulated 920k dot LCD in a relatively compact body. Like previous Nikons at this price it features a pentamirror viewfinder and 11-point AF system capable of tracking subjects by distance and color, as well as the still-improving full-time AF-F mode for use when shooting in live view mode. It also becomes the first Nikon DSLR to offer in-camera special effect filters while shooting either stills or video.

    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: Effective and easy to use features make the D5100 ideal for everyday photography/videography
        NotSoGoodFor: Shooting fast action
        Conclusion: The D5100 sits just above the D3100 in Nikon's product lineup, and as such, it combines its younger sibling's ease of use with a slightly more advanced feature set. The D5100's trump card, however, is its advanced 16 MP sensor, inherited from the D7000. Judged on its own merits, the D5100 is a great camera, but we're concerned that an enthusiastic beginner might outgrow it faster than some of the competition.
