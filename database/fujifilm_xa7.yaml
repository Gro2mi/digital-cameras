ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The Fujifilm X-A7 is an entry-level but well spec'd APS-C mirrorless camera. It features a 24MP CMOS sensor, hybrid autofocus system with nearly 100% coverage, a fully articulating LCD and 4K/30p video capture. The camera is compact and lightweight, and puts most of its controls onto its gigantic 3.5", 2.76M-dot touchscreen. The X-A7 is capable of shooting bursts at 6 fps with continuous autofocus, though its buffer fills quickly. UHD 4K video does not have a crop, though there is a 10 minute time limit. The camera offers a mic input, but there's no headphone jack. Connectivity options include Wi-Fi and Bluetooth.
