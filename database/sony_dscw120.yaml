ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: In our December 2008 budget camera group test the W120 came out near the top of all our image quality tests and produced consistently well exposed shots with good color, focus and sharpness. Equally importantly it is fast and responsive, even in low light. Throw in the slightly wider angle 4x zoom and image stabilization and stylish metal body and you've got the perfect pocket camera. It's not the cheapest camera you can buy, but we think it's well worth paying that little bit more.
