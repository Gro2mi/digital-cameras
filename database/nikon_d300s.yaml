ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The Nikon D300S is a relatively minor update to the D300 - the leading APS-C DSLR of its day. It's based around an updated, video-capable version of the 12MP CMOS sensor used in its predecessor. It offers a very slightly revised control layout and improved continuous shooting rate. The biggest change is the addition of the ability to shoot 720p24 HD movies (MJPEG). Beyond that it retains the rugged build, excellent 51-point AF system and 100% coverage viewfinder that made the D300 such a pleasure to work with. Improvements in sensor technology and Nikon's re-jigging of its lineup mean it is no longer the stand-out camera it once was.

    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: Pretty much anything from landscapes to sports
        NotSoGoodFor: Serious movie making
        Conclusion: A relatively minor upgrade to one of the defining cameras of the semi-pro sector adds a useful HD video mode and a wealth of minor improvements that improve the already excellent handling. Although the D300S has stronger competition than its predecessor, it still manages to impress, as do the images it produces.
