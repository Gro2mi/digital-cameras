ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The Canon EOS M6 is an enthusiast-friendly model in the company's mirrorless lineup. Like the other M-series models, it uses EF-M lenses with support for EF and EF-S via an optional adapter. It features a 24.2MP APS-C CMOS sensor with the company's Dual Pixel AF, which allows for fast autofocus in live view and movie mode. In a first for Canon, the M6 has in-body electronic 5-axis image stabilization in video mode. It has a rangefinder style body, and is being launched alongside an optional hotshoe EVF. It also has a 3-inch 1.04 million-dot tilting touch LCD. There is also WiFi, NFC and Bluetooth capability.

    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: Those with an existing collection of Canon lenses, those who need ease of video shooting over outright video quality and who appreciate build quality and a polished user interface.
        NotSoGoodFor: Sports and action photographers, anyone requiring high resolution video.
        Conclusion: The EOS M6 is a great camera for existing Canon enthusiasts and casual videographers alike. The autofocus performance continues to impress, and though many of its direct competitors offer 4K video and some form of viewfinder, the EOS M6 is a well-built camera capable of very good image quality.
