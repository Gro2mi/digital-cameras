ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The Ricoh PX is a rugged, waterproof compact camera. It combines a 16MP stabilized CCD sensor and 2.7" LCD with conventional camera styling. Despite its appearance, it can withstand a drop from up to 1.5m and being submerged to a depth of 3m for 60 minutes. Along with the camera, Ricoh has launched a range of silicone covers that help make the camera still-more durable.
