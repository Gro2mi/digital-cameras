ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The Fujifilm FinePix XP50 is a tough compact camera with 14MP CMOS sensor. The XP50 it's not as durable as the XP150 and XP100 that were co-announced but, being waterproof to a depth of 5m and shockproof from a height of 1.5m, it's still a lot more resilient than most compacts. It's built around the same 28-140mm equivalent zoom as its tougher brothers and, thanks to its use of the same CMOS sensor, is able to capture 1080p movies.
