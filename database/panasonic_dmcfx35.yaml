ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: Panasonic's first 10 megapixel compact sits near the middle of its premium 'FX' range and offers a much wider than normal 25-100mm (equiv.) 4x zoom lens that's ideal for shooting landscapes and cramped interiors and includes optical image stabilization. The tiny FX35's impressive feature set includes 720p movies and a much improved version of Panasonic's Venus processing engine. April 2009
