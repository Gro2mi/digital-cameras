ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: Ultra slim Cyber-shot with ultra high resolution 3.5" touch screen LCD, 4GB internal memory and 4x (35-140mm equiv.) zoom lens and all the latest easy auto features (including blink detection) that's capable of surprisingly good results but is let down a little by its user interface and handling issues - and a price tag that's hard to justify. (April 2009)
