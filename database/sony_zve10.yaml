ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The Sony ZV-E10 is an E-mount mirrorless camera with a 24MP APS-C sensor. The camera is designed for vlogging and features a fully articulating touchscreen, product showcase feature and soft skin features, a three-capsule microphone, and sockets for an external mic and headphones. It also has Sony's top-notch autofocus system, which tracks eyes and faces with ease. While it can capture 4K video, there's a hefty crop at 30p, but not at 24p. The ZV-E10 can live stream video (using UVC/UAC standards) over its USB-C connection.On the stills side, image quality is very good, bursts can be taken at 11 fps with continuous autofocus and battery life is best-in-class. While it lacks a mode dial, the camera is quite customizable.

    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: Vloggers and filmmakers shooting mostly static shots.
        NotSoGoodFor: Any form of vlogging that involves movement or capturing fast action. Stills shooters who want a viewfinder.
        Conclusion: 'As a vlogging platform, the ZV-E10 seemingly has a lot to offer: it shoots oversampled 4K/24p video using the full width of its sensor, features a selfie touchscreen, a good built-in directional microphone, headphone/microphone ports and class-leading video autofocus. Battery life is also top of its class and the camera is livestream ready, out of the box. Unfortunately, 4K video capture results in a distracting ''jello effect'' for clips with movement and/or fast action. And Full HD video shows poor detail capture compared to the competition.'
