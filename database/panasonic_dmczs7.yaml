ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: Panasonic hasn't changed the basic ingredients of the ZS series (ZS is the North American designation, the range is known as TZ everywhere else) much since its introduction. The GPS-equipped ZS7, like its predecessors, is a solid and pleasantly weighty metal-bodied camera with a good selection of exterior control points, complemented by a reasonably clear menu system.The 12MP ZS7 packs a useful 25-300mm (equivalent) lens which is amongst the most versatile currently on the market. As far as image quality is concerned, the ZS7 turns in excellent results overall, both in terms of detail reproduction and optical sharpness. Although key specifications are very similar to the slightly cheaper ZS5, if we had to choose between the two, we'd opt   for the ZS7 for its built-in GPS and higher quality LCD screen.

    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: all-purpose photography, especially travelling, where the built-in GPS is very useful.
        NotSoGoodFor: GPS drains the battery, and the ZS7 isn't at its best in poor light.
        Conclusion: The Lumix ZS7 is the top of the line of the 'original' travel zoom range, from Panasonic. As an all-purpose travel camera the ZS7 excels, and it's built-in GPS, despite being a drain on the battery, is great fun and very useful when travelling. It's not the best value camera in this group, but it does give some of the best results.
