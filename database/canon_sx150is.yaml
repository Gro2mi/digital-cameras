ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The PowerShot SX150 IS budget superzoom adds a 14.1MP CCD in the place of the SX130's 12MP chip. Beyond that the specs are familiar - a 12x 28-336mm equivalent image stabilized lens, 720p30 HD video recording and a comparatively low-resolution 230k dot 3.0" LCD screen. Canon brings its latest 'Intelligent' image stabilization technology to bear on the SX150, with the camera automatically selecting from seven different modes, based on its understanding of the type of shooting being conducted.

    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: Casual day to day photography, where the 12X lens is very useful
        NotSoGoodFor: More critical work, or anything requiring speed and responsiveness (which is where the SX150 IS really falls down)
        Conclusion: The Canon PowerShot SX150 IS is a neat little camera with some interesting tricks up its sleeve. Its weighty, contoured body makes it nicer to hold than some of its smaller peers, and in favourable conditions at low ISO settings, image quality is very good. A versatile lens and effective image stabilization system make this a great 'go-everywhere' camera as long as you can live with the relatively slow performance and poor battery life.
