ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The Nikon Coolpix S01 is a miniature compact camera built around tiny 10MP sensor. The S01 uses a 1/3"-type CCD sensor - a size more commonly found in smartphones to allow it to offer a 29-87mm equivalent zoom in a device just 77 x 51 x 17mm in size (3.1 x 2.1 x 0.7"). It features a 2.5", 230k dot touchscreen and uses a built-in battery (rated at around 190 shots) and 7.3 GB of internal memory.
