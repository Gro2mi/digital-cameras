ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: Very compact, well-priced and well-specified mid-range model from Nikon's Coolpix 'S' range. The 10 megapixel S600 boasts a versatile 4 times stabilized Nikkor zoom lens with a 35mm equivalent zoom range of 28-112mm, all wrapped up in an attractive metal body. It's also claimed to be one of the fastest cameras in its class, though we haven't tested this so, as usual, take this with a healthy pinch of salt.
