ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The Pentax S12 is the latest in a line of  slim metal-bodied cameras that stretches back to the Optio S, launched in January 2003.The S12 may boast a 12 megapixel sensor, but the 37-111mm zoom lacks a real wide angle, the design is dull and the user interface isn't a patch on the best cameras in this class. In good light it produces pleasant natural results and feels fairly speedy - though both output quality and focus speed go rapidly downhill in low light and at higher ISO settings. (April 2009)
