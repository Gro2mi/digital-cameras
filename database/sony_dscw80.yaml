ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: Announced in February 2007, the Cyber-shot W80 is one of three almost identical models that differ only in their pixel count. The W series has been gradually refined over the last few generations and now offers a more affordable alternative to the ultra-slim 'T' series whilst still offering a compact body, optical image stabilization and - new for these models - HDTV (1080i) output. Also new to the W series is a new multi-point AF system and - of course - face detection AF/AE. Otherwise the spec is pretty standard ultra compact fare; 3x zoom, 2.5-inch screen and a claimed 340 shot battery capability. Unfortunately, whilst it produces great results in good light, it's let down by poor low-light focus and flash performance. (April 2009)
