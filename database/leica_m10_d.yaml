ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The Leica M10-D is a rangefinder camera that has much in common with its sibling, the M10-P, but lacks an LCD and has a thumb rest styled as a film advance lever. If users want to change anything other than the shutter speed, aperture or exposure compensation, they'll need to do so via the Leica FOTOS app.The M10-D comes with a 24MP full-frame CMOS sensor and Maestro II processor and offers a top ISO of 50000 and a 5 fps burst rate. The M10-D has some degree of environmental sealing and lacks any I/O ports. An EVF is optional and is the only way in which users can briefly seen the photo they've just taken.
