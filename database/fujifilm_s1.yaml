ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: 'Manufacturer description: The FinePix S1 is the world’s first “weather resistant” super zoom bridge camera and provides protection against rain and dust. The S1 features a 16MP CMOS sensor, and a bright 50x super zoom 24-1200mm F2.8-5.6 lens with ultra-fast zoom speed and 2x Intelligent Digital Zoom up to 100x. The high resolution and contrast Vari-Angle 3” LCD (920K dot) makes it easy to frame shots from any angle, and the 0.2” EVF (920K dot) is great for difficult shooting conditions. One-touch WiFi connectivity lets you easily share images to your smartphone or tablet – pictures that these devices cannot capture - and remote shooting via smartphone or tablet using the Fujifilm Camera Remote app for unique capture opportunities.'

    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: Outdoorsy people and those who want to maximize image quality via Raw.
        NotSoGoodFor: Video shooters and those who desire best image quality straight out of the camera.
        Conclusion: 'The FinePix S1 is the only weather-sealed superzoom on the market, and it indeed feels better than its competitors. For the more enthusiast crowd it offers Raw support as well as a hot shoe. The camera performs well in most respects, most notably when focusing,  and the lens is better-than-average. Unfortunately there are quite a few negatives: image quality is sub-par, video recording is fully automatic, and the electronic viewfinder is not great.'
