ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The LX5 is the fourth camera to carry the LX name but Panasonic has not seen the need to meddle too much with the essential ingredients - the LX5 even features a redesigned version of the same sensor as its predecessor, the LX3. A fast-aperture Leica Vario-Summicron lens, compact metal body, flash hotshoe and plenty of external controls make the LX5 a very appealing camera for the photo enthusiast.

    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: Full-on manual control and low-light work, where the fast lens is invaluable. Also, the multi-aspect sensor is great for panoramics.
        NotSoGoodFor: Anything requiring speed, and outdoors in very bright light, when the LCD screen gives a very poor guide to exposure/color.
        Conclusion: Successor to the popular LX3, the LX5 brings a host of improvements and new features, including an excellent multi-aspect sensor, a slightly more versatile optical zoom range, and better ergonomics. It's not the fastest compact around, but it is a great camera for the enthusiast photographer or DSLR user who wants something a little smaller.
