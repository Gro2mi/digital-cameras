ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The Ricoh Caplio GX-200 replaces the GX100 and inherits the old model's 24 to 72 mm (equiv.) lens, manual controls and a removable (optional) tilting electronic viewfinder. Resolution has increased to 12 megapixels, the screen now measures 2.7 inches and the camera is controlled by the latest version of Ricoh's imaging processor - the Smooth Imaging Engine III. The GX-200 produces excellent results in a very limited set of circumstances - specifically, low ISO, bright light conditions in RAW mode. Outside of this comfort zone, the GX-200 is at best unremarkable, and at worst, awful. At ISO 400 and above, the GX-200 has the dubious distinction of producing some of the noisiest, least pleasant images we've ever seen from a modern camera. This is a shame, because in most other respects - metering, build quality and ergonomics, it is a pleasant enough companion.
