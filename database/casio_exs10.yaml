ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The Casio EX-S10 was, at the time of launch in January '08, the world's slimmest digital camera - a crown Casio seems loathe to relinquish. Into its tiny body the S10 manages to fit a variety of the latest consumer-friendly features including a series of automatic shutter modes - smile shutter, panning detection and blur minimization. It also includes the YouTube movie capture mode that Casio pioneered in its recent compacts. Unfortunately the camera is a lot more impressive than the results it produces, which are marred by unreliable auto focus and exposure systems and - for a camera so obviously aimed at the social user - the flash performance is disappointing.
