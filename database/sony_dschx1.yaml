ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: Latest in a long line of big-zoom, SLR-styled compacts is the first of a new generation of non-SLR models to feature the company's newly-developed high-speed 9 Mp Exmor CMOS sensor. Sporting a 28-560mm (35mm-equivalent) 20x zoom lens, the DSC-HX1 is capable of up to 10 frames per second in burst mode using a high-speed mechanical shutter. The new sensor also enables high definition movie capture up to 1080/30p and some novel features such as 'sweep panoramas' and multi-shot stacking low light modes. The image quality is decent enough in good light, but there are better, and given the price you have to really want those cool features to choose the HX1 over some of its considerably cheaper competitors.
