ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The Nikon 1 J1 represents Nikon's first foray into the mirrorless camera market, alongside the similarly specified Nikon 1 V1. The J1 features a 10MP 1" CMOS sensor and hybrid autofocus, combining both phase and contrast detection technologies. Full resolution burst shooting is available at 60 frames per second. The J1 offers a built-in flash rather than an accessory port for an external flash, and J1 users will rely solely on a 3.0 inch, 460,000 dot LCD for image composition. Other features geared toward the beginning photographer are available, including Motion Snapshot mode, which automatically captures short slow-motion video clips each time an photo is taken, compiling them into a single video file put to music.

    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: Compact camera upgraders who prefer an uncomplicated control layout
        NotSoGoodFor: Users who want a pocketable camera that will allow them to easily take control of camera settings as they gain experience
        Conclusion: The J1 will reward point-and-shoot upgraders with a noticeable bump in image quality, but it often fails to deliver acceptable results in lower-light settings when operated in its fully automated mode.
