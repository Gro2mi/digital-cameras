ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The K-7 is Pentax's latest enthusiast/semi-pro grade DSLR. It the first Pentax DSLR to have a magnesium-alloy body making it smaller than the K20D it replaces, while still offering reassuring build quality. The body is weather sealed (though not weather proof) and features a 920,000 dot LCD and 100% viewfinder and the ability to shoot 720p HD movies. Like the models before it, the K-7 has image stabilization built into the body, stabilizing all lenses. It offers the high level of exterior control you'd expect on a camera at this level and its operation can be customized to a high degree.

    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: Anyone wanting a semi pro camera that won't make a hole in your pocket or weigh you down too much.
        NotSoGoodFor: Low light work, movie makers
        Conclusion: Semi-pro spec for mid-range money makes the K-7 an incredibly attractive option for the serious photographer wanting something a little less mainstream without compromising performance. Solid as a tank and feature packed--yet surprisingly compact--the K-7's only real weak spot is its high ISO performance.
