ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The 16MP Pentax K-5 IIs DSLR is built around a weather-sealed magnesium alloy body and is bundled with the SAFOX X, autofocus sensor. This 's' version of the company's 2012 flagship model which costs $100 more, comes without an anti-aliasing filter, to offer higher resolution at the risk of more prominent moiré interference patterns.Though they don't represent hugely significant upgrades to the original K-5, the Pentax K-5 II and its close relative the K-5 IIS still hold their own in the current SLR market, with excellent image quality from a proven 16MP CMOS sensor, solid build, and a well thought-out interface. We like the tight, simple design of the K-5 II, one that offers quick access to a rich feature-set.

    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: Enthusiast and landscape photographers, those interested in trying photography without a low-pass filter.
        NotSoGoodFor: General-purpose photographers who are likely to encounter moiré-inducing subjects like fabric, buildings, and other man-made objects.
        Conclusion: Bearing all that the K-5 II does, minus an optical low-pass filter, the K-5 IIS is a specialized camera made for those who want a little more detail and know how to handle the resulting artifacts. Its weatherproof design and small, tight build make it ideal for landscape photographers, as well as anyone who spends a lot of time outdoors.
