ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: Pentax Optio X90 superzoom boasts a 26x optical zoom lens. Featuring the same 12MP image stabilized sensor inherited from the previously released X70, it offers a slightly longer zoom range at 26-676mm equivalent, an electronic viewfinder with dioptre adjustment and a longer lasting battery. Rest of the features mirror the X70 including the 2.7 inch LCD, P/A/S/M exposure modes and HD video recording. In many respects the Pentax X90 is an average camera. Its feature set, base ISO image quality and operational speed are adequate without standing out significantly from its competitors. We like the long (26x) zoom lens and the compact dimensions, which make the Pentax an ideal carry-anywhere superzoom, but were not too impressed with the camera's performance in low light - neither in terms of autofocus, nor image output (still or video).

    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: Photographers who want a lot of zoom in a small package
        NotSoGoodFor: Photography in dim lighting conditions
        Conclusion: The Samsung offers a long zoom at an attractive price point but overall the feature set is nothing out of the ordinary and the image quality lacks a little behind the competition in some areas. It's a compact superzoom that does the job but you might find better alternatives.
