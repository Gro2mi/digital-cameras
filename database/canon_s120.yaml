ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: Canon’s S120 is maintains the popular features of its popular S-series predecessors, but promises to be faster and brighter. The 24-120mm focal length of the S110 remains unchanged, but with a brighter f/1.8-5.7 maximum aperture range. The touch screen has improved resolution, and allows the user to utilize its touch AF control even during video. The S120’s video is also bumped to 60p, and retains use of the optical zoom while shooting. Rather than using an electronic motor as past S-series cameras did, the pop-up flash is now deployed via a sliding switch on the left side of the camera.
