ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The Panasonic Lumix S5 is a hybrid stills/video camera that has a 24MP full-frame sensor. Like the other members of the Lumix S family, it uses the L-mount developed with Sigma and Leica. The S5 has built-in 5-axis image stabilization, which can reduce shake by up to 6.5 stops with compatible lenses. A high-res mode uses the IS system to produce 96MP images with much higher levels of detail. It has a fully articulating LCD with 1.84 million dots and a large EVF with 2.36M dots.On the video side, the S5 can capture 10-bit 4K at up to 60p. V-Log and V-Gamut have a claimed dynamic range of over 14 stops. Panasonic has improved the accuracy of continuous autofocus in video mode and face/eye/body recognition accuracy in all shooting modes. The S5 has mic and headphone sockets, and supports Panasonic's XLR adapter. The compact but well-built body is weather-sealed and has two SD card slots (one of the two supporting UHS-II speeds). It has dual-band Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. The camera can be powered and charged over its USB-C connector.

    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: Amateur videographers who also want a capable stills camera
        NotSoGoodFor: Stills shooters who need to capture fast action or want a better through-the-viewfinder experience
        Conclusion: The Panasonic Lumix DC-S5 is an full-frame mirrorless camera that's great at both still and video shooting. Its well-built, fairly portable and feature-packed. Image quality is in-line with its peers, though autofocus is a little bit behind. The S5's video features are the best in its class and video quality is impressive, as well.
