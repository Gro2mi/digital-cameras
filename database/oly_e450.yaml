ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: Upgraded version of the E-420 compact DSLR. The new E-450 is essentially identical to the E-420 apart from the addition of 3 Art Filters, a new processor and an improved LCD display. It's perhaps a testament to how well specified the E-420 is that Olympus has clearly struggled for ways to improve it. For fear of treading on the toes of the E-620 (which itself stands uncomfortably close to the more expensive E-30), Olympus has engineered a model with the fewest changes over the existing version we've ever seen. And, despite the company's insistence that it will continue to offer four entry-level cameras, we do not believe the E-450 is distinct enough from the E-420 that they two can sensibly co-exist.
