ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The Cyber-shot DSC-WX9 compact with Sony's 16.2 MP back-illuminated 'Exmor-R' CMOS sensor can record 1080i60 HD videos and shoot 10fps full resolution shooting. It is bundled with a 5x optical zoom lens starting at a wide 25mm, a 3.0" LCD and includes a useful HD output. It includes Sony's 2011 features including Sweep Multi-Angle - a 3D shooting mode sweep that lets you view images moving in simulated 3D right on the WX9's display by tilting the camera back and forth and an Backlight Correction HDR feature that compiles the highlights, mid-tones and shadows from three separate shots to create a single image with a wide dynamic range.
