ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The SX130 IS combines the A-series' build quality, AA-battery power and value for money with a long zoom.The SX130's zoom range has been increased to 12x but more importantly now comes with a real wide-angle (28mm). Compared to its predecessor (SX120 IS) it also sees a resolution increase to 12MP, SDXC support,HD movie recording and additional scene modes including a Miniature mode. The rest of the features remain the same including a 3.0" LCD, P/A/S/M shooting and image stabilization.
