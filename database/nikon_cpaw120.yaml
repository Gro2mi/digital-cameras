    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: Divers and outdoorsy photographers who want a broad feature set at a great price.
        NotSoGoodFor: Those taking most of their photos in bright sunlight. Full size image quality inspectors.
        Conclusion: First and foremost, the Coolpix AW120 is an amazing value, packing in a ton of features - most of which well-designed - for less than its competitors. It has a great GPS implementation, Wi-Fi, and 1080/60i video. It does not, however, have a great display, and heavy noise reduction smears away detail in photos.
