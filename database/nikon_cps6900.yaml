ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: 'Manufacturer description: Featuring a 3-inch Vari-angle touch screen, built-in kickstand and front shutter release button, the COOLPIX S6900 is designed to capture fun and flattering self-portraits with ease. Equipped with a 16-megapixel CMOS Sensor, 12x Optical Zoom NIKKOR ED glass lens and 24x Dynamic Fine Zoom, users can take close-up “selfies,” group shots and portraits with extreme detail and accuracy. The camera also includes built-in Wi-Fi with NFC connectivity for easy sharing with friends. Incorporating lens-shift VR technology, camera shake is minimized to ensure sharp images and HD video. Combine the S6900’s target-finding AF and 20 scene modes, users can instantly focus on capturing stunning photos and videos, rather than modifying their settings when the shooting situation changes.'
