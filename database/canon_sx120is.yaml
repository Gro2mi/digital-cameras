ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The Canon super-zoom PowerShot SX120 IS was launched in August 2009 as the successor to the SX110 IS. It features the same 10x zoom lens (36-300mm equiv.) and 3 inch LCD of its predecessor, but has seen the resolution increase to 10MP. The rest of the features are similar to the the SX110 IS including P/A/S/M shooting modes but with faster Face Detection that can detect up to 35 faces. Despite the lack of a real wide-angle and the usual image quality issues at higher ISOs in this class the SX120 IS is a great choice for anyone on a budget wanting a well-specified camera with full photographic control and a big zoom range.
