ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The 20MP D500 is Nikon's flagship APS-C format DSLR. With continuous shooting speeds of 10 fps and a 200 shot buffer for Raw images, the camera is aimed squarely at action and fast-paced photographers who don't mind the smaller sensor, or even benefit from its extra reach. It features the same 153-point AF system and 180k-pixel RGB metering sensor of the professional full-frame D5, along with the same EXPEED 5 processor. It can also capture 4K/UHD video and also features 'SnapBridge', a constant connection to a smartphone using Bluetooth.

    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: Anyone looking to shoot sports or crucial-moment photography. Photographers looking for a durable camera with excellent ergonomics.
        NotSoGoodFor: Landscape photographers needing more resolution or anyone looking for easy portability. Photographers looking to dabble in video.
        Conclusion: The D500 is among the best DSLRs we've ever tested. Its strengths are its superlative autofocus combined with the ability to keep shooting at 10 frames per second. There are other APS-C cameras that offer similarly excellent image quality but none that offer the speed, ergonomics and dependability of the D500.
