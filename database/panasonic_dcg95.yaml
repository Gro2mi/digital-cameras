ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The Panasonic G95 is a Micro Four Thirds mirrorless camera with a 20MP LiveMOS sensor. Like other Panasonic mirrorless models, it has built-in Dual IS 2, that combines in-body and in-lens stabilization to reduce shake by up  to five stops. The G95 also uses the company's Depth-from-Defocus contrast-detect AF system. The G95 is capable of shooting at 9 fps with focus and exposure locked on the first shot, or 6 fps with continuous AF.The G95's body is larger and heavier than the G85 that preceded it, with a more substantial grip, additional buttons and relocated dials. It has a high resolution OLED viewfinder as well as a fully articulating touchscreen LCD display.On the video front, the G95 can capture UHD 4K video at 30p/24p with no official limit on recording time. Since the camera isn't using the full width of the sensor, there is a substantial crop when shooting 4K. The G95 has Panasonic's V-LogL gamma curve built in, and 8-bit 4:2:2 video can be sent to an external recorder. Both microphone and headphone jacks are included.Wi-Fi and Bluetooth are available for remote capture and image transfer. The G95 is CIPA-rated to 290 shots per charge, though a power saving mode triples that number. A battery grip is optional.

    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: Those seeking a rugged, stills-focused camera for travel and photos of friends and family.
        NotSoGoodFor: Those seeking a light and portable camera; videographers and wedding photographers.
        Conclusion: The Panasonic Lumix DC-G95/G90 is a good all-around mirrorless camera, though it doesn't stand out in any particular area. Its build quality is very good, with plenty of direct controls, in-body IS and an EVF that is much larger than those on its peers. Image quality is very good, though behind its competitors that use larger sensors. Video quality is fine in daylight, but falls behind when light is poor. In addition, a 1.25x crop when shooting 4K video doesn't limits your lens selection for wide-angle video capture.
