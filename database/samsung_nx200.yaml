    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: Photographers who want to capture a lot of low ISO detail in a compact package
        NotSoGoodFor: High-ISO photography in JPEG mode, action photography
        Conclusion: The Samsung NX200 is an obvious choice for anyone who wants lots of pixels in a small package. The camera is slightly let down by long buffering times in raw mode and the JPEG engine's noise treatment at high sensitivities, but overall the NX200 is a powerful photographic tool with a good feature set for its class, and it's enjoyable to use.
