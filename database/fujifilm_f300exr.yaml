ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The Fujifilm F300 EXR debuts a new Hybrid autofocus system that the company claims is as fast as that on DSLRs. The camera automatically chooses between using the contrast-detection AF method used in compact cameras and the phase-detection method usually used in DSLRs. In addition the F300 offers a 15x optical zoom lens starting at a wide 24mm, a 1/2" 12MP Super CCD EXR sensor and a 460k 3.0" LCD. The image stabilization system has also been tweaked, adding a 'Gyro' sensor to detect a wider range of camera movements that can contribute to shaky images. Other features include manual exposure modes, 360 degrees Motion Panorama and a Super Intelligent flash that attempts to balance flash illumination across the foreground and background.
