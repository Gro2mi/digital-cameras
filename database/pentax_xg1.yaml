    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: Those on a budget who want a compact, long zoom camera.
        NotSoGoodFor: Those who want quick access to camera settings, reliable image stabilization, a full day of shooting without draining their battery. Frequent electronic viewfinder users.
        Conclusion: The Pentax XG-1 is a bargain, but that's pretty much all that's going for it. On the positive side, it's relatively compact with good build quality, the grip is large, and image quality is respectable. The bad news is that it has no control dials, which makes adjusting settings a bear, image stabilization is sub-par, Wi-Fi and 1080/60p video are both missing, and the electronic viewfinder is poor. Battery life was also the worst amongst its peers.
