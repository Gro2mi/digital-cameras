ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: Canon describes the PowerShot SD4500 IS (IXUS 1000 HS in Europe) as the world's slimmest super zoom camera, though that's always a crown destined to be worn for a very short period of time. Measuring 22mm at the thinnest side, it features the company's 'HS' system first featured in the SD4000 IS, promising better low-light performance and high-speed photography. It shares the same 10MP back-illuminated CMOS sensor and 3 inch LCD as the SD4000 IS, but offers a longer 10x zoom range starting at a rather over-long 36mm equivalent. The image-stabilized camera can record full HD movies as well as Super Slow Motion movies at 240fps, and (in Europe, at least) represents ten years since the IXUS range first went digital.
