ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The Olympus OM-D E-M10 is a more affordable option in the OM-D lineup. The camera includes the same processor as its big brother, the E-M1, plus a 16MP four thirds sensor, built-in wi-fi, electronic viewfinder, and a 3-axis in-camera image stabilization system (the E-M5 and E-M1 have 5-axis stabilization). The E-M10 can shoot 8 fps for up to 20 RAW images, or 3.5 fps with continuous auto focus with tracking. The camera has the familiar look and feel of OM-D cameras, with a metal build and two metal control dials. The E-M10 is the first OM-D to include a built-in flash, with a sync speed up to 1/250.

    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: Street photographers, students, those who want lots of customization or want a camera they can grow into.
        NotSoGoodFor: Dedicated videographers, sports shooters
        Conclusion: The Olympus OM-D E-M10 is positioned as the entry-level OM-D camera, though it's just as capable in most ways as its more advanced siblings. It borrows the E-M5's impressive imaging capabilities, without the weatherproofing, and adds built-in Wi-Fi. The E-M10 offers an impressive level of direct control in a camera body that's light and compact.
