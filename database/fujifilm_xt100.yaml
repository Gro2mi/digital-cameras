ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The Fujifilm X-T100 is a midrange SLR-styled mirrorless camera. Largely based on the entry-level X-A5, the X-T100 has a fully articulating (rather than tilting) touchscreen and also borrows a good-sized OLED EVF from the X-T20. It has a 24MP CMOS sensor, a hybrid autofocus system with 91 phase-detect points, Fujifilm's well-liked Film Simulation modes and 4K/15p video capture. The X-T100 is equipped with Wi-Fi and Bluetooth for easy photo sharing.

    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: Travel, portrait and landscape photographers who want excellent image quality, an articulating LCD and top-notch selection of lenses.
        NotSoGoodFor: Capturing anything moving or recording video. Shooting bursts of Raw images.
        Conclusion: The Fujifilm X-T100 is a SLR-style mirrorless camera with excellent photo quality plus a unique articulating LCD, high-res viewfinder and great battery life. However, its autofocus subject tracking abilities are disappointing, with only 15 fps recording at 4K and overall poor video quality.
