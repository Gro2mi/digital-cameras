ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The Casio Exilim EX-H20G is the the world's first compact to feature Hybrid GPS. The technology enables the camera to track the camera when indoors or away from the GPS satellite signals. It uses three-axis accelerometers and its three-way direction sensor to determine the location since it last received a signal. The H20G is built around the company's EX-H15 inheriting its 14.1MP sensor, 10x (24-240mm) zoom lens and 3.0" LCD . It can also record 720p HD videos with H.264 compression, and features a faster Exilim Engine HS engine.
