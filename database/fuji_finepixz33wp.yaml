ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: Fujifilm's first waterproof digital camera has a slim, curvy 20mm-thick body and not unpleasant styling. Spec-wise it's pretty standard fare, with a 10MP sensor, 3x optical zoom and a 2.7" LCD and all the latest easy-to-use features and is available in a range of striking colors. Waterproof to 3 meters for up to 2 hours the FinePix Z33WP also sports large rubberized buttons and a small grip to avoid losing it in the surf.
