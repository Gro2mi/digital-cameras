ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The Q7 is Pentax's third Q-mount model and the first to feature a 1/1.7" type sensor - helping make it more directly comparable with the enthusiast compact class of cameras. The 12MP BSI CMOS chip fits into the smallest, lightest mirrorless interchangeable lens system on the market, offering improved image quality without making the body any larger. Magnesium alloy build and extensive direct control reinforce the enthusiast-friendly impression, and the Q7 gave good results in our testing.

    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: Enthusiast shooters interested in available light photography and casual portraits looking for a very small camera with the ability to change lenses.
        NotSoGoodFor: Enthusiasts who would give priority to low light shooting, resolution, depth of field control and lens selection over compact size.
        Conclusion: 'The Pentax Q7 does well in everyday shooting, delivering image quality that''s generally as good as the best enthusiast compacts. Though we have few serious complaints about its performance, it faces stiff competition from other fixed and interchangeable-lens cameras with larger sensors. The main selling point of the Q7 over its larger-sensored peers is the most obvious one: its small size.'
