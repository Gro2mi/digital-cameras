ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The Sony SLT-A65 was launched alongside the SLT-A77 - the long-awaited replacement for the DSLR-A700. Although somewhat overshadowed by its higher-end stablemate at the time of its launch, the cheaper SLT-A65 has more mass-market potential and we believe there's every chance it's the A65 that will have the greater long-term impact. The A65 lacks the A77's magnesium alloy construction and new AF sensor (it uses the same 15-point AF sensor that we saw in the original SLT-A55). It also does without the A77's top-plate LCD, rear control dial and uses a simpler hinge mechanism for the rear display, but importantly, it is built around the same 24MP APS-C CMOS sensor and the same 2.4M dot OLED viewfinder.Overall the Sony SLT-A65 is an exceptionally well specified camera not only considering its class, but the consumer-level DSLR field as a whole. Quite apart from its 24MP sensor, the A65's OLED EVF, full-time live view system and 10fps continuous shooting mode are unmatched by its more conventional DSLR peers, and when you add the well thought-out ergonomics to that formula you end up with a camera that deserves both your attention, and our highest award.

    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: Feature-lovers and photographers on a budget who want maximum pixel count
        NotSoGoodFor: Traditionalists and pixel peepers
        Conclusion: The Sony SLT-A65 is an exceptionally well specified camera for its class. The 24 MP CMOS sensor, the OLED EVF and the 10 fps continuous mode are real stand-out features in the mid-level bracket of the market. Add the well thought-out ergonomics to that and you got yourself a camera that is a pleasure and fun to use in almost any shooting situation.
