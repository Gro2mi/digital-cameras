    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: Capturing the moon and still wildlife from incredible distances.
        NotSoGoodFor: High image quality for most situations, focusing on moving subjects,  a long day of shooting
        Conclusion: The Nikon Coolpix P1000 is all about its incredible zoom range. If you need a focal length of 3000mm, it's the only game in town. If you don't need that much zoom then there are far better cameras for equal or less money.
