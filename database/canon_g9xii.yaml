    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: Everyday point-and-shoot photography
        NotSoGoodFor: Sports and action, portraiture, long excursions.
        Conclusion: The PowerShot G9 X Mark II is a pocketable camera that packs a 1"-type sensor and 28-84mm equivalent F2.0-4.9 lens. On the surface it offers good build quality, a broad feature set, an intuitive touch-based interface and excellent connectivity. However, its lens is very soft, which greatly affects image quality, and battery life is poor.
