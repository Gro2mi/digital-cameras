    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: All-purpose go anywhere photography in good lighting.
        NotSoGoodFor: Low light still photography and video in any lighting.
        Conclusion: The Pentax WG-1 GPS has a competitive feature set for the 'rugged' compact camera class, including a few bells and whistles like its intervalometer. Image quality and performance is also competitive, but the WG-1 GPS fails to deliver in low light and its video is relatively poor. Overall it is good value, but is bested in quality and features  by a few competitors at similar price points.
