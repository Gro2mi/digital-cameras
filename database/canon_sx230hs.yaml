ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: GPS-enabled 12MP compact superzoom with manual controls, 3 inch LCD and 14x(28-392) zoom lens. Users have the option to shoot Super Slow 340 x 240 movies at 240fps and 1080p24 Full HD video. There is also a Movie Digest mode that records a short video clip right before shooting a still image and then combines one day's worth of clips into a VGA-resolution video. Canon offers an optional waterproof case for this model.Overall, the Canon Powershot SX230 HS has a lot going for it, with an elegant body and consistent performance in key areas like autofocus, zoom, and white balance. In a wide variety of shooting situations, we were able to produce very pleasing photographs without too much hassle, which is the entire point of this class of camera. Even when the going got tough, indoors and at night the Canon continued to produce quality photographs.

    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: General everyday use, especially when travelling
        NotSoGoodFor: Distortion and chromatic aberration can impact upon image quality in some situations
        Conclusion: The SX230 HS is one of the best-featured cameras in its class, and came out top in our testing for detail reproduction in both good and poor light. High ISO performance is excellent, but lens distortion and chromatic aberration can be problematic in some shooting situations.
