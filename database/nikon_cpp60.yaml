ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: Successor to the Coolpix P50, the P60 is a slightly unusual camera that combines a 5x (36-180mm equiv.) zoom, a decent level of photographic control and an electronic viewfinder into a very compact body. It's neither a point-and-shoot-only ultra compact nor a fully-fledged photographers' camera. Instead it's a pocketable digital camera that marries a sensible sensor to a decent zoom and keeps the the cost to a minimum.
