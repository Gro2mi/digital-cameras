ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The Sony Cyber-shot DSC-RX100 is an enthusiast compact camera based around a 20MP 1" CMOS sensor. It features a 28-100mm equivalent lens with F1.8-4.9 aperture range and image stabilization and is the first Sony compact to capture Raw files. It can shoot 1080p60 and capture 17MP (16:9 crop) stills simultaneously. It features a lens control dial and a 3:2 aspect ratio sensor (the same proportions as most DSLRs). It's also the first Sony compact to feature the company's 'White Magic' LCD technology, promising a brighter or lower-power display.

    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: Enthusiasts looking for a carry-everywhere camera. Developing photographers who don't want the cost and bulk of interchangeable lenses.
        NotSoGoodFor: Low light work (compared to a large-sensor camera) or fast action shooters.
        Conclusion: The RX100 is probably the most capable compact camera on the market today, combining the image quality benefits of a mid-sized sensor with the proportions of a conventional compact. Extensive, though not flawless, manual controls make the RX100 a great second camera for DSLR shooters.
