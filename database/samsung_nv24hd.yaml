ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The first Samsung compact to offer 720p HD movie recording is also one of the few models on the market with a 24mm (equivalent) wide lens (at the short end of its 24-86.5mm zoom). The comprehensive feature set, unique user interface and stylish design are all very appealing, but question marks over  image quality continue to dog Samsung's assault on the premium and enthusiast compact camera market. (April 2009).
