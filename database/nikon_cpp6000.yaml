ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: With its plethora of features and manual controls, the P6000 (which replaces the P5100) is - of all the cameras in its class - the one that gets closest to delivering SLR style control and handling in a truly pocketable format. . As you would expect Nikon has increased the megapixel count on the new model, but fortunately hasn't stopped there. The lens now offers a 28mm wide angle (from 35mm on the P5100) and the P6000 is also one of the first digital cameras featuring a built-in GPS receiver for geo-coding your images, and even has wired LAN connectivity. JPEG image quality is something of a mixed bag, but the inclusion of a raw mode does at least give you the option to fine tune the processing to your own taste.
