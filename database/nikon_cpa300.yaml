ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: 'Manufacturer description: With the 8x optical zoom the Coolpix A300 is capable of vibrant close-ups with no compromise to image quality. When using optical zoom or shooting on the move, the camera''s high-performance Vibration Reduction (VR) effectively reduces camera shake for an effect equivalent to a shutter speed 3 stops for sharp, crisp images even without a tripod. Additionally, a focus distance of 2 cm for macro photography allows users to get closer to their subjects to capture the tiniest details. A Scene Auto Selector automatically identifies the optimum camera configuration for up to 10 scenes in various conditions, from backlit spaces, to portraits at night. A help system is also available. Video can be captured at 720p with 4-axis hybrid VR.'
