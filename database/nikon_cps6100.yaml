ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The Coolpix S6100 comes with a 3.0 inch touchscreen LCD and a 7x optical zoom lens. With mostly touch-based operation it is Nikon's first compact camera to feature a 16MP CCD sensor. The camera is capable of recording 720p HD movies and its built-in HDMI mini connector allows playback on your HDTVs. For families who want to make photo playback a more fun experience can add the camera's built-in animated character effects and music to create slideshows before playback.
