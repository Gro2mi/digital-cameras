ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The PowerShot G3 X is a premium superzoom with a 1"-type, 20MP BSI-CMOS sensor. This sensor, along with Canon's DIGIC 6 processor, permits an ISO range of 125-12800. The G3 X sports an F2.8-5.6, 24-600mm equivalent lens with 'Intelligent' image stabilization and its rugged body is sealed against dust and moisture. The autofocus system has 31 points and Canon claims a burst shooting speed of 5.9 fps. The G3 X features a full suite of manual controls, including Raw support and a hot shoe, and there are numerous customizable controls, including the focus ring around the lens. The back of the camera features a tilting 3.2" LCD with 1.62M dots and touch functionality (an electronic viewfinder is optional). Video is recorded at 1080/60p with manual exposure control and mic and headphone jacks. As with most cameras these days, the G3 X also has built-in Wi-Fi with NFC.
