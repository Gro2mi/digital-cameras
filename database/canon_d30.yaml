ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The Canon PowerShot D30 is a compact waterproof and rugged camera that is capable of going deeper under water than any other waterproof camera on the market (as of February 2014) without using a separate underwater housing. The D30 is built around a 12MP CMOS sensor, and a 28-140mm F3.9-4.8 lens. The camera is shockproof to 6.5 feet, and temperature resistant from 14° to 104°F. The D30's built-in GPS tracker records the location and time of all the images and videos you capture. The new Sunlight LCD mode claims to correct a common complaint with waterproof cameras, making it easier to see the monitor in bright sunlight.

    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: Shooters who want a good everyday camera that performs well underwater, and don't mind the lack of Wi-Fi.
        NotSoGoodFor: Low light shooters, those seeking more data than location alone, social network photo sharers
        Conclusion: The PowerShot D30 isn't the most feature-packed rugged camera, with basic GPS functionality, dated movie mode and no Wi-Fi. Importantly though, it takes good photos in nearly all situations, including underwater.
