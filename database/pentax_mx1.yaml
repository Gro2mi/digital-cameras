ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The Pentax MX-1 enthusiast compact camera features classic styling and construction, with brass top and base plates. It's based around a stabilized 12MP BSI CMOS sensor and a familiar-sounding 28-112mm equivalent F1.8-2.5 lens. In addition the MX-1 features a flip-out 920k dot rear screen. It includes a top-plate exposure compensation dial and rear thumb wheel to control a UI very much like those in the company's DSLRs.

    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: Those looking for a high quality camera with a great sensor and sharp lens, who also like a little style and heft for extra stability.
        NotSoGoodFor: Enthusiasts looking for more rapid control over exposure and other settings. Anyone looking for a camera that slips easily into a pocket.
        Conclusion: Pentax's first entry into the premium pocket camera category is big on image quality but also a bit big for the pocket, which narrows its niche a little more than its competitors. Still, it's a very capable camera with a good set of features, a handsome finish, and an impressive sensor and lens combination.
