ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: Replacement for the K100D/ K100D Super, the K200D is aimed at the entry level segment of the market where it has to compete with the likes of the Nikon D60 and the Canon EOS 450D.Despite of a fairly tempting price point the K200D certainly does not compromise on features. It comes with a CCD-shift type 'Shake Reduction' system, Dust Removal and Pentax' 11-point Safox VIII AF system. Very unusually for this class of camera it also sports a weather-sealed body and a relatively large viewfinder - though no live view system. To get the best quality you'll need to shoot raw, but overall we've few complaints about the output.
