ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The Sigma dp1 Quattro is the next generation of its DP series of APS-C sensor, fixed focal length cameras. The latest, 28mm-equivalent, model features dramatic styling and a fundamental re-think of the company's Foveon multi-layer sensor design. The Quattro sensor still uses three layers to detect color information but now only captures its full, 19.6 million pixel resolution in the top layer, with lower two layers capturing 4.9MP of information each.
