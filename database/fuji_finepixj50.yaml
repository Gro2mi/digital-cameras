ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: Another fairly anonymous budget compact from Fujifilm's expanding 'J' range. Fairly well specified for its price (the 5x zoom doesn't have much of a wide angle, but has a decent telephoto reach) and it has a higher resolution screen than many cameras at this price point.
