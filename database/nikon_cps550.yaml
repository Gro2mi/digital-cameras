ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: Another affordable and very compact all-metal Coolpix from Nikon's 'S' range. At the time of launch it was the world's smallest 10 megapixel compact with a retractable 5x zoom (a claim so specific it's hard to glean much from it). That aside it's an attractive, slim camera with a decent feature set for the price and a much higher resolution screen than the L models below it in the range.
