ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The Nikon Coolpix P300 compact offers manual controls via twin control dials and an F1.8-4.9 lens. It incorporates a 1/2.3" 12MP back-illuminated CMOS sensor, 920K dot 3.0" LCD and features 1080p30 Full HD movies and P/A/S/M shooting modes. Although at first glance it looks a lot like the Canon Powershot S95 and Olympus XZ-1, the P300 is a significantly different camera in a couple of important ways. It offers higher resolution, at 12MP rather than the 10MP common in that class. It also offers Full HD video (1080p as opposed to 720p), but its true colors are betrayed by a lower price-point, a smaller sensor (1/2.3" as opposed to 1/1.6" or 1/1.7"), and the inability to record RAW files. The market for high-end compact cameras with a small form factor is booming at the moment, and we're certain that, purely because of its styling, a lot of consumers will regard it as a cut-price alternative to cameras like the Canon Powershot S95 and Panasonic Lumix LX5.

    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: Those who don't need RAW capability but want a compact with a good deal of manual control.
        NotSoGoodFor: Critical photography or images to be used for large prints.
        Conclusion: The P300 is a decent compact that provides a good number of manual shooting controls that place this camera a step above other point and shoots. Unfortunately the absence of RAW capability and over-processing at base ISO prevent this camera from achieving its potential.
