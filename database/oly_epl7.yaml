ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The Olympus PEN E-PL7 is a mirrorless camera that offers many of the features of its more expensive OM-D siblings and puts them into a compact package. It features a 16MP CMOS sensor with in-body image stabilization, a fast 81-point AF system, and 8 fps continuous shooting. Self-portraits are easy with a 3" LCD that can flip down 180 degrees. Built-in Wi-Fi allows you to remotely control the camera, which includes video recording and live bulb monitoring. Video can be recorded at 1080/30p with stereo sound. While the camera lacks a built-in flash, a small external flash is bundled.
