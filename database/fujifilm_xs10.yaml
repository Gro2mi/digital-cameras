ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The Fujifilm X-S10 is a DSLR-style mirrorless camera with a 26MP X-Trans BSI-CMOS sensor. Unlike other Fujifilm X-series cameras, it has a more traditional control layout and a larger grip. It uses the same sensor, processor and AF system as the X-T4, though it's 5-axis image stabilization system is a miniaturized and 1/2-stop less effective. The camera can shoot bursts at 30 fps with a crop or 20 fps without using the electronic shutter, or 8 fps with the mechanical shutter. The camera has a mode dial rather than the shutter speed and exposure compensation dials found on other X-series models. It also has a pop-up flash. The built-in OLED viewfinder has a magnification of 0.62x and resolution of 2.36 million dots. The LCD is fully articulating and touch-enabled. A mic input is built in, and headphones can be used via an included USB-C dongle. The camera can be powered over its USB port.The camera can capture 4K video (DCI and UHD) for up to 30 minutes. Lovers of high-speed video can shoot at up to 240 fps by dropping down to Full HD. The X-S10 supports F-Log, 8-bit 4:2:0 internal recording, 10-bit 4:2:2 external recording and the company's popular Eterna color profile.

    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: Generalist photography, including landscapes, portraits, studio work, run-and-gun video shooting.
        NotSoGoodFor: Sports and action specialists that need the best autofocus performance they can get.
        Conclusion: The Fujifilm X-S10 is an excellent generalist photographers' camera. It has great image quality, strong video quality and features, and fast burst speeds for capturing fast action. Our only real reservation concerns its autofocus system, as the tracking performance has simply fallen behind what rival cameras are capable of. Otherwise, it proves to be a capable companion for landscape, portrait, travel photography and more.
