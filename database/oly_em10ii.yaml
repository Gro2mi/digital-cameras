ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The Olympus OM-D EM-10 II is the follow-up to the company's E-M10 from 2014. It features the same 16MP Live MOS sensor but adds 5-axis stabilization, which reduces shake by up to 4 stops. Its design is reminiscent of the E-M5 II except that it's not weather-sealed. The mode and twin control dials on the top plate are tiered, making them easy to operate. Photos can be composed on a 2.36M-dot OLED EVF or a tilting 3" touchscreen display. The camera has numerous scene and special effect modes, full manual controls, and in-camera Raw processing. Full HD video can be recorded at 24p and 60p, at bit rates up to 77Mbps. The camera also supports Wi-Fi connectivity.

    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: Budget-minded photographers who don't want to skimp on features. Those seeking a compact 'second camera'.
        NotSoGoodFor: Video enthusiasts and those who wish to keep moving subjects in focus.
        Conclusion: The Olympus OM-D E-M10 II is an inexpensive yet well-specified mirrorless camera whose design, image quality, performance and feature set make it a compelling choice. That said, the E-M10 II's menus can be confusing, the lack of 4K video is disappointing, and subject tracking needs improvement.
