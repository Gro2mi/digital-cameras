ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The SH100 Wi-Fi enabled digital camera allows users connect to wireless networks for sharing images and videos. The camera also allows users to pair up with compatible smartphones to enable geo-tagging, control the camera remotely or preview the scene. It offers the same 14.2Mp sensor, 3.0 inch touchscreen LCD and HD video recording capabilities of the previously released ST80 Wi-Fi camera, but comes with a more useful 26-130mm equiv. zoom lens.
