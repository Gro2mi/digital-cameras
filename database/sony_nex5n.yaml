ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The Sony Alpha NEX-5N is the fourth model in Sony's NEX line of APS-C format mirrorless interchangeable lens cameras. Just as the NEX-C3 replaces the NEX-3, the 5N is a direct replacement for its predecessor the NEX-5, using the company's latest 16.1MP CMOS sensor in place of the previous 14MP chip. Although the 5N is nearly indistinguishable from the NEX-5 on the outside (and is bound to be regarded as such by many casual observers), it is actually a very different camera, and one that is worthy of serious attention.In terms of image quality the NEX-5N sits untouched at the top of the mirrorless interchangeable lens compact category. The low-light capability of its APS-C format CMOS sensor matches or exceeds what we've come to expect from the best of the current crop of APS-C DSLRs as well. Considering its sub $700 price point this is truly impressive, and makes the 5N a very attractive option for anyone looking to upgrade from a compact camera, or even as a second body alongside a more conventional DSLR outfit.

    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: Photographers upgrading from compact cameras, looking for the benefits of a large APS-C sensor without the size of a traditional DSLR.
        NotSoGoodFor: People looking for a pocketable DSLR replacement.
        Conclusion: The NEX-5N is great little camera with big camera image quality. If you are looking to transition into enthusiast photography and want DSLR image quality in a small size, the 5N is definitely worth a look.
