ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: Ricoh's Pentax KP features a new 24MP APS-C sensor with a top ISO of 819200 and an electronic shutter that can reach 1/24000 sec. It's the first Pentax camera to offer 'Shake Reduction II' 5-axis in-body image stabilization, which can reduce shake by up to 5 stops with nearly any lens you attach. The SAFOX 11 autofocus system features 27 points, 25 of which are cross-type.The compact body is weather-sealed and functions at tempatures down to -10C/+14F. The camera has replaceable grips, making it comfortable to hold for nearly everyone. Keeping with Pentax tradition, the KP has a pentaprism optical viewfinder with 100% coverage and a 0.95x (0.63x equiv.) magnification. A tilting 3" touchscreen LCD is also available.The KP can shoot continuously at up to 7 fps and can capture video at up to 1080/60i (a 30p option is available for those who want to avoid interlacing). As one would expect, Wi-Fi is built-in. The camera uses the familiar D-LI109 battery and can take up to 390 shots per charge.
