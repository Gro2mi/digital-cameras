ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The 14.2MP Samsung ST600 is a dual LCD compact camera with a large 3.5" rear LCD and a 1.8" front LCD. Featuring larger displays and higher resolution compared its DualView predecessor; it comes with a 27-135mm equiv. lens. The touchscreen compact is ideal for party-goers and casual snappers who want to properly frame themselves in their photos and videos and be part of the action by stepping out from behind the camera and joining friends and family in front.
