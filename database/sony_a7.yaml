ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The Sony Alpha 7 is a full-frame E-mount mirrorless camera. The A7 is very similar to its more expensive sibling (the A7R), except that it uses a 24 megapixel CMOS sensor with on-chip phase detection. The A7 twins are the smallest and lightest full-frame cameras on the market. While the cameras can use any E-mount lens, there will be a crop factor involved (unless you don't mind vignetting). Sony is producing a new line of FE-series lenses that take advantage of the larger sensor.The A7's use the new Sony Bionz X processor, which produces images with better detail, less noise, and reduced diffraction. Other features include a 3-inch, tilting LCD, XGA OLED electronic viewfinder, Multi-interface (hot) shoe, Wi-Fi with NFC, and 1080/60p video recording.

    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: Those seeking a full-frame sensor in a small body, determined third-party and historic lens owners, video enthusiasts, and social media mavens
        NotSoGoodFor: JPEG shooters, Auto ISO users, and photographers who want to quickly capture a moment
        Conclusion: The Alpha 7 has broken new ground in the full-frame market, in terms of both size and price. While it's not perfect, the a7's compact size, broad feature set and very good raw image quality arguably make up for issues like relatively poor battery life and slightly overprocessed JPEGs.
