ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The Olympus OM-D E-M10 Mark III is a low-cost, SLR-style mirrorless camera that's both powerful and easy-to-use. It sports a 16MP Live MOS sensor paired with the company's latest TruePic VIII processor and has 5-axis image stabilization built right into the body. Entry-level users have four "shooting assist" modes to making taking photos easy, and the tilting 3" touchscreen display lets you snap a picture with the tap of your finger. The E-M10 III has numerous customizable buttons, twin control dials and a handy shortcut button. It has a 121-point contrast-detect AF system and can shoot at 4.8 fps with continuous AF. It can also capture 4K/UHD video at 24p and 30p, and a high-speed 120 fps mode is available at the 720p setting.

    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: Increasingly keen beginner photographers
        NotSoGoodFor: Sports shooters or anyone demanding dependable autofocus
        Conclusion: The E-M10 III is an attractive camera that does a good job of making its range of capabilities accessible. It's flexible and enjoyable and relatively easy to shoot good 4K video with. Its unreliable focus tracking and modest resolution take a little gloss off a camera that gives plenty of room to grow into.
