ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ2500 (FZ2000 in some markets) is the company's video-centric superzoom camera. It features a 20MP 1"-type CMOS sensor, 24-480mm equiv. F2.8-4.5 lens, a 3" fully articulating LCD and large electronic viewfinder. The camera can shoot continuously at 7 fps with live view and continuous AF and uses Panasonic's impressive Depth from Defocus autofocus system. While the FZ2500 has a ton of features related to stills shooting, including a clever new Focus Stacking option, the 'focus' is on video. The camera can capture both DCI and UHD 4K video at both 30p and 24p. There's a full suite of capture tools available, ranging from zebra patterns to SMPTE color bars.

    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: Video enthusiasts who want extensive controls, inputs, and outputs.
        NotSoGoodFor: Those 'focused' mainly on still photography. There are better choices in this class for less money.
        Conclusion: The Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ2500/FZ2000 is a well-designed enthusiast bridge camera focused on video, and it offers capture tools that you won't find on any other camera in its class. 4K video quality is excellent, though there's a substantial crop factor, essentially knocking out the wide end of the lens. Still image quality is decent, though it's hampered by a so-so lens and JPEG engine that could use a tune-up. If you're a videophile then it's a top choice. If not, there are cheaper options out there.
