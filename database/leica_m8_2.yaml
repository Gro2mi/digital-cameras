ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The M8.2, as the name suggests, is a revision to its original M8 model. It retains the same underlying specifications, including its 10MP 1.33x crop sensor but gains a series of minor updates. The shutter material and behaviour is adjusted to make the camera quieter and the rear screen is protected by sapphire glass. The viewfinder is also modified, with the framing lines optimised for focus at 2m, rather than the M8's 0.7m, to assist with accurate framing. In keeping with the camera's aim of being more discreet, black versions of the 8.2 have the company's logo on a black background.
