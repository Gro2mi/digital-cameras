ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: Replacement for the A480, the A495 was launched at CES 2010 along with sister model the A490 (which is only available in one color and has minor spec differences - most notably a lower-spec 5 point AF system). Offering a relatively slim plastic body, 2.5" LCD, Smart Auto mode, 3.3x zoom and lots of automatic shooting modes, the A495 is typical entry-level stuff. silver, red and blue
