ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The CoolPix S210 is a surprisingly affordable 'ultra compact' from one of the biggest names in photography. It sits at the bottom of Nikon's 'S' series of small, metal-bodied compacts in terms of specification, price and size. It lacks some of the finesse, speed and high quality construction of most of the other cameras in the 'ultra slim' class and offers a comparatively basic feature set, but it is one of the smallest cameras you can buy and it can match many more expensive models on image quality. If you want something truly pocketable that won't break the bank the Coolpix S210 is a reliable, if slightly pedestrian option.
