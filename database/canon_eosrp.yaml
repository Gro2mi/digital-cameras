    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: Newer users getting into full-frame for the first time, existing Canon users looking for a second camera body, anyone looking for a travel-friendly full-frame camera for casual use.
        NotSoGoodFor: Those looking to shoot high quality video, power users who want the most out of their Raw files, and those who routinely shoot fast action and need faster burst speeds.
        Conclusion: The Canon EOS RP's specifications aren't exactly exciting, but don't let that fool you - it's a likable little camera with engaging controls, good build quality and it produces excellent JPEGs. Of course, the Raw files are noisier and aren't as malleable as some more contemporary full-frame cameras, but for the target audience, that won't likely be a deal breaker. For those users looking for a friendly way to get into full-frame imaging, the EOS RP is an excellent option.
