    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: Full frame shooters looking for a smaller, lighter and less expensive alternative to pro-level DSLRs. Enthusiasts who often shoot at high ISOs or want shallow depth-of-field.
        NotSoGoodFor: Sports shooters, travel shooters wanting something truly lightweight or anyone who regularly uses far off-center focus points.
        Conclusion: The Nikon D610 brings full-frame capabilities to a larger audience while retaining most enthusiast-friendly features. Image quality at high ISO sensitivities is very good, and a wealth of customization options enables quick access to most shooting controls. The slight improvements and fixes over the D600 make it a strong competitor in this part of the market.
