ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: Nikon's first foray into the compact/long zoom arena is a slightly odd beast that sits roughly halfway between  compact travel zooms (such as the Panasonic TZ series) and the SLR-style super zooms such as its own P90 (though despite appearances, it doesn't have an eye level viewfinder of any kind). It's certainly very small for a camera with a 15x optical zoom (covering a useful 28-420mm equiv. range), but its mini-SLR styling means it's far from pocketable. Lens aside the L100 is - like all Nikon's L series cameras - a true 'point and shoot' model, with little manual control, but the 3.0" screen, image stabilization and ease of use features (not to mention keen pricing) will undoubtedly appeal to many.
