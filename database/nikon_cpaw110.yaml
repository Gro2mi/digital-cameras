    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: Divers, serious GPS lovers, or anyone who wants an easy-to-use rugged camera that takes good pictures and movies. Wi-Fi connectivity and a low price make it even more appealing.
        NotSoGoodFor: Photographers who don't want to color correct underwater photos. Those taking photos in bright outdoor sunlight, or expect to get a full day of shooting on a single battery charge.
        Conclusion: The Coolpix AW110 is a capable rugged camera with good photo quality for its class, an elaborate GPS feature, Wi-Fi for remote camera control, and a nice movie mode - all without breaking the bank. It can also go further underwater than any of its peers. Downsides include smudged details, blue color casts underwater, poor outdoor display visibility, and below average battery life.
