ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The Nikon D5300 is an upper entry-level DSLR that improves on the D5200 by removing the optical low-pass filter (OLPF) from its 24MP CMOS sensor, and featuring true 60p HD video capability, and a slightly larger 3.2in side-articulated 1.0M-dot tilt/swivel LCD. The D5300 features a 39-point AF system, based around the same Multi-Cam 4800DX AF sensor that is used in the D7100, and the same 2016-pixel RGB metering sensor. The D5300 is Nikon's first DSLR to feature built-in Wi-Fi and GPS.

    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: Those looking for high-resolution image quality, photographers likely to upgrade from kit lens, enthusiast videographers and those who place a priority on connectivity.
        NotSoGoodFor: Sports and action photographers, those who want direct access to shooting settings, those who want to shoot stills in live view.
        Conclusion: The D5300 is a very good upper-entry-level DSLR with a high-resolution sensor and solid video features. It's bigger than mirrorless competitors and it's priced on the high end of its class, but it won't let down a budding photographer, especially those who plan to upgrade from the kit lens to higher-quality optics.
