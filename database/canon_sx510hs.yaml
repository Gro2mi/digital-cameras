ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The PowerShot SX510 HS improves over its SX500 predecessor with an upgraded “HS” high-sensitivity CMOS sensor, rather than a CCD.  With its 30x optical zoom, starting at the 24mm wide angle, users get a flexible super zoom. The camera’s Zoom Framing Assist feature automatically maintains the correct distance from the subject using a face recognition sensor to track and capture subjects. The Zoom Framing feature works in both still and video modes. Another new addition is built-in Wi-Fi, allowing users to share wirelessly to social media.  Users can also upload images from almost anywhere via their compatible iOS® or Android™ device with the download of the free Canon CameraWindow app.
