ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: Almost certainly the last Fujifilm digital SLR, the S5 Pro is, like all its predecessors, built around a Nikon body (in this case the D200). The big selling point is the unique 12MP 'SR' sensor, which uses dual photosites to capture far wider dynamic range. The S5 Pro still rules the roost in this area, which is why it remains popular with wedding and portrait photographers. The Nikon body is excellent (if now a little dated), the dynamic range and color rendition still impress, and the only real downside is the relatively low resolution and lack of pixel-level sharpness.
