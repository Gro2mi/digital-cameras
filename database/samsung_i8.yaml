ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: Samsung has been pushing the idea of an all-in-one 'Personal Media Player' (PMP) / camera for several years now. The i80's smart design and large touch-screen LCD can't hide the fact that it's a budget camera with basic MP3 and MPEG movie playback functionality. If the thought of watching movies or listening to music on your camera appeals then the older i85 offers a slightly more impressive camera at a similar price. (April 2009).
