ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: 'Manufacturer description: The Leica M (Typ 262) features a high-resolution CMOS full-frame sensor, designed exclusively for rangefinder photography, but excludes video recording and Live View. The 24-megapixel sensor delivers exceptional image quality and extreme sensitivity, and makes the Leica M (Typ 262) the ideal camera for photography in available light situations. At the same time, the camera’s Maestro processor guarantees fast processing of captured images, ensuring that it is immediately ready to shoot. For maximum discretion when shooting, the Leica M (Typ 262) shutter is barely audible – an invaluable advantage in situations where the photographer needs to remain unobtrusive. As an aid to this, the camera features a shutter cocking system that is considerably quieter in single exposure mode than that of the M (Typ 240), and enables a shutter release frequency of up to two frames per second. In continuous mode, the M (Typ 262) has the same sequential shooting speed as its sister model and shoots up to three frames per second. The handling of the Leica M (Typ 262) fulfils everything a discerning photographer expects from a Leica M. This includes the rapid manual focusing process with the coupled rangefinder and the focusing ring of the lens, as well as the option of selecting automatically determined or manually set shutter speeds. Furthermore, as this model does not include Live View or video recording, the menu is extremely straightforward and consists of only two pages. This ensures that all settings are rapidly accessible at all times. White balance is selected by a dedicated button on the back of the camera.'
