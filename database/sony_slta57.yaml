ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: Sony's SLT-A57 is the replacement for the original A55 fixed-mirror, electronic viewfinder SLT. The A57 still features a 16MP sensor and LCD viewfinder but incorporates them into essentially the same body as the more expensive A65. Use of the latest Bionz processor means the A57 offers a wider-than-ever selection of photographic features and image processing modes. There's also an optional HVL-LE1 video-lighting LED panel.At its core, the A57 is a well put-together compendium of Sony's technological advances since the introduction of the A55 two years ago. This makes it a solid and proven performer for anyone stepping up to a DSLR from a compact camera or ILC, and one that concedes little in terms of either value or performance to its competitors from Canon, Nikon and Pentax.

    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: Users who frequently switch between EVF and rear LCD viewing and video-shooting enthusiasts.
        NotSoGoodFor: Dedicated sports shooters and those who prefer an optical viewfinder.
        Conclusion: The A57 combines a high-quality 16 MP sensor, easy access to shooting parameters, and class-leading video performance. And does this while providing an equivalent shooting experience, whether composing images via the EVF or rear LCD.
