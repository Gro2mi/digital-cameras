    ExecutiveSummary: 'Manufacturer description: The new E-mount ILCE-QX1 model is the world’s first lens-style camera that gives photography enthusiasts a whole new way to take advantage of their Alpha Mount System  lens collection.  Compatible with Sony’s growing range of E-mount lens offerings including zoom, portrait, wide-angle, macro and more, the new QX1 camera features a built-in 20.1 megapixel APS-C size Exmor CMOS sensor that grabs huge amounts of detail for landscape shots and beautiful ‘bokeh’ background defocus.  It’s teamed with Sony’s advanced BIONZ X processor that now features improved area-specific noise reduction for stunning low-light images.  The unique new QX1 camera features a wealth of other premium features, including Superior Auto, RAW image shooting and a pop-up flash to brighten up portraits in backlight situation, gloomy interiors and night scenes.'
