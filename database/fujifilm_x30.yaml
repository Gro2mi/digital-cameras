    ExecutiveSummary: 'Manufacturer description: The FUJIFILM X30 gives enthusiast and professional photographers a vast array of new features, and delivers the same award-winning image quality and design that the FUJIFILM X-Series is known for around the world. The new X30 features a Real Time Viewfinder – which is the largest, brightest, fastest and highest resolving viewfinder in its class – a large 12MP 2/3" X-Trans CMOS II sensor, EXR Processor II and a new ‘Classic Chrome’ film simulation mode that delivers muted tones and deep color reproduction for beautifully dramatic images. The X30 also includes a large tilting 3.0" 920K-dot premium clear LCD monitor, increased battery performance, and a strong, yet lightweight, die-cast magnesium alloy body that is superbly designed to add a real sense of style and elegance to the camera.'

    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: Photographers looking for a second carry-everywhere camera with plenty of manual controls.
        NotSoGoodFor: Anyone looking for class-leading image sharpness or the ultimate in low-light performance.
        Conclusion: Image quality from the X30's 2/3” 12MP sensor is very good, and while there are better-specified (and larger-sensored) compact cameras out there, the X30's combination of enthusiast-friendly ergonomics, classic styling and good everyday picture quality is very attractive.
