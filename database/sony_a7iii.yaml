ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The Sony a7 III is a 24MP full frame mirrorless camera that incorporates many of the features and improvements found in the a7R III. Primary among these are a BSI sensor, along with the larger capacity 'Z' battery, AF joystick and the company's impressive EyeAF feature. Its 693-point AF system offers 93% frame coverage. Continuous shooting is offered at up to 10 fps with mechanical shutter, and 5-axis in-body stabilization claims a 5.0 stop shutter speed advantage.Video recorded at 4K/24p is taken from a 6K region of the sensor, while 30p shooting comes from a roughly 5K region with a 1.2x crop. The camera offers both S-Log2 and S-Log3 gamma curves for shooting wide dynamic range scenes or Hybrid Log Gamma for playing back directly on high dynamic range displays. The new larger-capacity battery boasts 710 shots per charge. The a7 III uses the same 2.36m dot OLED viewfinder as its predecessor, giving a 1024 x 768 pixel view, rather than the higher-res version in the a7R III. The viewfinder is complemented by an articulated 3" 921k-dot LCD.

    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: Generalist photographers, wedding, event and action shooters and those that need high quality video.
        NotSoGoodFor: Those that need more resolution for detailed scenes or large prints, those that need ultimate build quality for harsh shooting conditions.
        Conclusion: The Sony a7 III is a well-priced, well-rounded camera suitable for all kinds of photography. Twenty-four megapixels of resolution is more than sufficient for most tasks, and the 693-point autofocus system and 10 frames-per-second burst speed help the a7 III keep up with fast action. Video quality and feature set is another strong point, though some operational lag, a slightly low-resolution viewfinder and unintuitive video autofocus may turn off some users.
