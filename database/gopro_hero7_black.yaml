ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The GoPro Hero7 Black was introduced alongside Silver and White Hero7 versions, and of the three cameras the Black offers the highest specifications. It records 4K/60p and 2.7K/120p video, as well as 1080p at up to 240 fps. It captures 12MP stills and unlike the Silver and White versions, uses a removable battery rather than built-in. The Hero7 Black also offers the first generation of the company's HyperSmooth digital image stabilization.
