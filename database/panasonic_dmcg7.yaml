ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The Panasonic Lumix DMC-G7 is the latest in the company's line of DSLR-styled mirrorless cameras. It offers a 16MP Four Thirds sensor and a Micro Four Thirds lens mount, and gains 4K video recording. A revamped 4K Photo Mode makes it easier to utilize high resolution video recording for stills shooting. It provides a built-in 2,360k-dot OLED electronic viewfinder alongside a fully articulated 3" 1040k-dot LCD.  Wi-Fi is built in, though there's no NFC as provided on the Lumix DMC-G6.

    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: 'Beginners looking for a camera to grow in to or DSLR owners looking for a smaller, lighter second camera: especially those interesting in shooting video.'
        NotSoGoodFor: Users wanting simplicity from their shooting experience. Photographers obsessed with absolute image quality.
        Conclusion: The Panasonic G7 is an impressive all-rounder, combining solid image quality, impressive autofocus performance and 4K (UHD) capability into a compact body with extensive external controls. Its user interface can be a little unwieldy but has moments of genius in the ability to use the rear screen as a touch pad to set AF point when shooting with the camera to your eye.
