ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The XZ-1 is Olympus' entry to the newly revitalized enthusiast camera sector. It features a 10MP sensor that is 60% larger than most compact cameras to offer improved low-light performance. This capability is boosted by the brightest lens on any current compact - a 28-112mm equivalent with a maximum aperture range of F1.8-2.5. These features, combined with a lens-surrounding control dial and P,A,S,M modes makes it an enjoyable photographers' camera whether as an only-camera or a more convenient companion to a DSLR. Its lens is bright enough to offer similar control over depth-of-field to a DSLR with a typical kit lens and, though it can't compete in low light, its image quality in daylight is competitive too. A VGA-equivalent 3.0" OLED screen and fast, simple interface complete an impressive little camera.

    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: Enthusiast and keen photographers, whether they be upgraders from point-and-shoots or seasoned DSLR users.
        NotSoGoodFor: Users wanting direct access buttons for every function.
        Conclusion: The XZ-1 combines simple direct controls with an excellent lens to create probably the best photographers' compact currently available. The output JPEGs are great and the balance of lens range, brightness and compactness make it a really appealing package, whether as an only camera or as a more pocketable backup for DSLR owners.
