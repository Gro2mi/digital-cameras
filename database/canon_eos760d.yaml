ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The EOS Rebel T6s (EOS 760D outside of the US) is designed for photography enthusiasts, or those who are already experienced with entry-level cameras who want to take high-quality photos and videos, and look for more advanced features and functions. These features include an LCD info display on the top plate, a quick control dial on the rear, horizontal level, HDR movie mode, and Servo AF in live view.It features a new 24MP CMOS sensor which features Canon's Hybrid CMOS AF III system for use in live view and movie recording. The sensor, along with a DIGIC 6 processor, offers an ISO range of 100-12800 (expandable to 25600). The autofocus system has 19 points, all of which are cross-type.Photos can be composed via an optical viewfinder or a fully articulating 3" touchscreen LCD. The T6s can shoot continuously at 5 fps. Video can be recorded at 1080/30p with manual exposure control and an external mic jack. It, along with its cheaper sibling (T6i/750D) are also the first Rebels to have built-in Wi-Fi (with NFC as well).

    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: Those looking for an inexpensive, well-built body to pair with Canon glass, and those looking to shoot a lot in live view. Users wanting to take more control of their camera.
        NotSoGoodFor: Those wanting top-notch AF performance in viewfinder shooting of moving subjects. Those looking for extensive customization of camera buttons and functions.
        Conclusion: The Rebel T6s brings resolution and low-light performance in line with its 2015 peers. The 19-point, all cross-type AF system is a welcome upgrade to the line, but is limited in its coverage and isn't good at following subjects moving around the frame, though formidable live view AF can somewhat make up for these deficiencies. Handling is excellent due to a fully articulating LCD, twin dials, and a top LCD.
