ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The Panasonic FX37 manages to combine cute styling, usability and an incredibly versatile 25-125mm zoom lens into a compact, well built body that, whilst a bit fatter than some of its competitors, doesn't feel any bigger in the hand. Panasonic has also added the ability to record 720p HD video, promising a remarkably flexible creative tool that - whilst not offering anything particularly special image quality terms - has much to commend it to the more serious photographer wanting something truly pocketable.
