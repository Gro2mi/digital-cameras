ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The Sony ALpha SLT-A33 and A55, are the first cameras to incorporate Sony's translucent mirror design. The Single Lens Translucent (SLT) cameras offer live view with full-time fast phase-detection AF whether in stills or movie shooting. This is achieved by having a fixed, semi-transparent mirror that redirects a small amount of light onto the AF sensor while allowing the rest through onto the main imaging sensor. The A55 is built around a 16.2MP sensor while the A33 features a 14.2MP unit. Both feature 3.0" articulated LCDs, full HD video recording and ISO sensitivity up to 12,800, while the A55 also features built-in GPS. As well as being highly innovative, both cameras are fast, responsive and capable of excellent image quality.

    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: Feature-hungry photographers from entry- to enthusiast level
        NotSoGoodFor: Anyone who expects real pro-level sports camera performance at a budget price
        Conclusion: The Sony SLT-A55 is an excellent all-rounder with a comprehensive feature set. The translucent mirror technology gives it an innovative touch and the best live view AF on the market. Continuous-shooting performance is the best in its class--just don't plan on shooting the Olympics with it.
