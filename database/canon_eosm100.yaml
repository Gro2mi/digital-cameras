    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: First-time camera buyers and beginning photographers interested in general photography, travel photographers, anyone looking for a small camera with great image quality.
        NotSoGoodFor: Advanced photographers that want more direct control, video shooters that need a better feature set, and photographers that want to get into sports and action photography.
        Conclusion: The EOS M100 is Canon's smallest and cheapest mirrorless interchangeable lens camera, and is perfectly suited to its intended audience of smartphone users looking to step up their photography game. The touchscreen controls are polished and approachable, image quality is great, and the full auto mode works impressively well. Video and burst shooting specifications are behind the competition, but overall, the M100 is a solid camera that represents a great value in Canon's lineup.
