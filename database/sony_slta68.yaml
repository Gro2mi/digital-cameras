This phase detection system uses no less than 79 autofocus detection points including 15 cross points, plus a dedicated F2.8 AF sensor point for dimly-lit scenes. It all adds up to fast, wide area AF with predictive tracking that locks faithfully onto fast-moving subjects.And thanks to Sony’s unique Translucent Mirror Technology, the A68 delivers constant AF tracking at up to 8 fps continuous shooting.Full HD movies use the efficient XAVC S format for high bit rate recordings at up to 50Mbps with outstanding detail and low noise. And thanks to Sony’s unique Translucent Mirror Technology, you can enjoy non-stop continuous autofocus that effortlessly tracks moving subjects for crisp, professional looking footage, whichever format you choose to record in.'
