ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: Surprisingly well specified metal-bodied budget camera looks like a real bargain. Scratch the surface, however, and you discover Olympus has managed to produce the perfect product for someone who wants a cool looking camera but isn't actually that bothered about taking pictures, with performance and picture quality that struggles to be anything more than merely adequate.
