ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The Powershot SD950 IS was launched in 2007 and replaced the previous year's SD900 as the flagship of the IXUS/ELPH/IXY range. The new model retained its predecessor's titanium shell but added a new intervalometer and image stabilization to the feature list, stretched the zoom range to 3.7x and increased the sensor resolution from 10 to 12 megapixels.
