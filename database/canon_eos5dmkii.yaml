ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: How do you follow a classic? That's the question Canon faced when it got to work producing a successor to the EOS 5D. The original 5D was the first 'affordable' and lightweight (in relative terms) full frame camera. Its successor the 5D Mark II boasts 21 megapixels, 1080p video, 3.0" VGA LCD, Live view, and higher capacity battery. It is a camera that aims to leapfrog its direct competitors, both in terms of resolution and video capability.

    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: Studio, landscape and low light photographers wanting full frame and the best possible image quality. HD Movies.
        NotSoGoodFor: Action / sports / wildlife
        Conclusion: Although some aspects of the spec (AF, metering) are looking a little long in the tooth, the superb image quality and class-leading movie output should ensure the Mark II is as popular as its predecessor. The numerous smaller improvements are welcome, and if you want full frame (without going to an even more expensive pro body) the 5D Mark II is about as good as it gets right now.
