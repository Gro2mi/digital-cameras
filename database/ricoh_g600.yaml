ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The Ricoh G600 is a water and dust resistant digital compact camera. The G600 is smaller than the 500G Wide it replaces but still offers a versatile 28-140mm equivalent lens with 1cm closest focusing distance. Its rugged casing conforms to all manner of US defense and Japanese standards (including the ability to survive being immersed in water for half an hour), meaning you should never have to worry about carrying it with you.
