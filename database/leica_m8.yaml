ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: Leica's first digital variant of its 'M' series rangefinder design that dates back to 1954. The M8 is unashamedly traditional in many aspects of its design (it is, after all, a manual focus rangefinder) but incorporates relatively advanced technologies, such as off-set sensor microlenses to gain optimal performance from the system's close-mounted lenses. Its 10MP CCD sensor is an unusual 27x18mm, creating a 1.33x crop compared to its 35mm film cousins. The lack of effective IR/UV filters on the sensor requires the use of screw-on filters on the lenses, taking the gloss off what aims to be a no-compromise 'classic' camera.
