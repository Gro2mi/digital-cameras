ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The Panasonic DMC-FZ150 CMOS-powered 24X superzoom is a replacement for the slightly unloved FZ100 and incorporates a lower-resolution 12MP sensor that the company says will outperform its predecessor's 14MP chip. The camera retains a 25-600mm equivalent lens but now incorporating 'Nano Surface Coating' to mitigate the effects of internal reflections. And, just like its predecessor, the FZ150 retains the ability to record Raw images. The FZ150 also shoots 1080p60 HD movies in the recently-created AVCHD Progressive standard.In challenging conditions the FZ150 gives better image quality than its predecessor thanks, in great part, to Panasonic's decision to go with a much more capable 12 megapixel CMOS sensor instead of the FZ100's unimpressive 14MP unit. A wide angle, image-stabilized 24x (25-600mm) zoom, raw mode, full manual and automatic controls, an articulated LCD, full HD video and 3D capture are only some of this highly capable camera's feature highlights but look away from the impressive spec sheet and you'll find that image quality is very good too, across the span of the camera's 24x optical zoom lens.

    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: The ultimate 'general purpose' camera, the FZ150's versatile 24X zoom lens is just as capable when it comes to wideangle landscapes as it is for extreme telephoto shots
        NotSoGoodFor: Like all 'megazooms', when it comes to applications where critical image quality really matters, there are better cameras out there.
        Conclusion: THE FZ150 is a solid and capable superzoom camera that boasts impressive image quality considering it's 24X optical zoom range. Sharpness is high, aberrations are well-controlled, and its capable optical image stabilization system makes working at its extreme effective focal lengths relatively pain-free.
