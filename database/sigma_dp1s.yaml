ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The DP1s is a slightly revised version of Sigma's DP1 large-sensor compact camera. Featuring the same sensor and processor as the DP1, it assigns the QS (Quick set) function from Sigma's DP2 to its digital zoom button and the ability to simultaneously shoot separate RAW and JPEG images. The company says it also performs better when shooting backlit subjects.
