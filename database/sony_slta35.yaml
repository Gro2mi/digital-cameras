ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The SLT-A35 DSLR replaces the A33 and features a new 16.2MP EXMOR APS-C CMOS sensor. The chip has been redesigned to improve power consumption, promising improved battery and thermal performance. The A35 can shoot 1080i60 video and shoot 7 frames per second at 8.4MP, a 1.4x crop from the middle of the sensor that Sony is calling Tele-zoom High Speed Shooting. In our tests the A35 performs very well, although it handles in an almost identical manner to its predecessor the A33. Image quality is very good, and although noise levels are a little higher than the best of the competition, the A35 Is capable of producing excellent stills and video.

    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: Anyone who wants a lot of cool digital features at an entry-level price.
        NotSoGoodFor: Traditionalists who can't do without an optical viewfinder.
        Conclusion: The Sony SLT-A35 is an excellent all-around performer that gets all the basic stuff right and is fun to shoot with. The feature set is great for a camera at this price point, and if you can live without an optical viewfinder, the SLT-A35 is a very good alternative to more traditional DSLRs.
