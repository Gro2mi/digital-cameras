It uses Canon's DIGIC 4+ image processor which offers an ISO range of 100-6400, expandable to 12800, as well as 3p fps burst shooting. It features a 9-point AF system with a cross-type sensor at the center. The EOS T6 is also outfitted with a 3-inch, 920,000-dot LCD or, of course, an optical viewfinder.

    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: Beginners, JPEG shooters, bargain hunters.
        NotSoGoodFor: Those looking for best-in-class resolution and dynamic range, video or extras like panorama or filter modes.
        Conclusion: The Canon EOS Rebel T6 provides a beginning photographer with good image quality right out of the box. It's a lightweight, easy-to-use DSLR with Wi-Fi for quick photo sharing. Its sensor lags behind the competition and its Live View shooting experience is frustrating, but it produces nice JPEGs without much work on the user's part. Overall, its very reasonable price point makes it a good buy for beginners.
