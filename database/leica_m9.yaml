ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The M9 was Leica's first 'full-frame' digital rangefinder, enabling the use of most Leica 'M' series lenses at the originally intended field-of-view. The 18MP CCD sensor is fitted with a filter that avoid the M8 and 8.2's need for lens-mounted UV and IR filters. It retains the classic M series look and build quality while promising a no-compromise approach consummate with its not-inconsiderable price-tag. While beautifully engineered and undeniably capable as a photographic tool, the M9 understandably lacks some of the digital sophistication offered by more mass-market products and its sensor isn't a match for the latest CMOS designs in low light. Its lack of anti-aliasing filter enables it to capture astonishing levels of detail at lower ISO settings though.
