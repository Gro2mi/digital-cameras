ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: 'Manufacturer description: The S2900 offers an effective pixel count of 20.1-million pixels, and is equipped with a 5x optical zoom NIKKOR lens that covers the wide-angle 26 mm to telephoto 130 mm angles of view (equivalent focal lengths in 35mm [135] format) and utilizes Dynamic Fine Zoom to increase zoom capability up to approximately 10x, all in a slim body with a depth measuring approximately 19.8 mm. 10x Dynamic Fine Zoom makes it easier for users to enjoy zoom photography equivalent to approximately 260 mm (equivalent focal length in 35mm [135] format). In addition to an array of in-camera image editing functions, the S2900 is equipped with a number of functions that make capturing beautiful images easy while leaving everything up to the camera, including Scene Auto Selector, with which the camera identifies the subject and shooting conditions to automatically enable the optimal scene mode, and Target Finding AF, with which the camera automatically focuses on the most suitable subject when the user simply frames a photo.'
