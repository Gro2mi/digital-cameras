ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: 'The Canon PowerShot G7 X Mark III is a premium compact camera with a new 1"-type, 20MP Stacked CMOS sensor. The stabilized lens is the same as on its predecessor: 24-100mm equiv. F1.8-2.8. The G7 X III retains the same 3" touchscreen display, which can flip upward by 180° for selfies and vlogging. The most notable feature on the G7 X III is the ability to live stream video on YouTube straight from the camera. It can also capture cropped 4K/30p and uncropped 1080 video at up to 120p. Impressively, the G7 X III can shoot Raw images at up to 30 fps with its electronic shutter with locked focus, or 8.3 fps with continuous AF, both with a healthy buffer. The camera can be powered over its USB-C port and has built-in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth.'

    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: Those seeking a pocketable camera with a versatile lens that will perform better in low light than a typical compact. Vloggers.
        NotSoGoodFor: Action and landscape photographers. Those who want an EVF for shooting outdoors.
        Conclusion: The Canon PowerShot G7 X III is a compact, well-priced camera which offers very good image quality, a fast lens, good ergonomics and the ability to stream live video straight to YouTube. Its lens isn't super-sharp at wide-angle, video autofocus is so-so, and live streaming is difficult to get working, but overall, it's a good value for the money and well worth considering.
