ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: Built around the same design and core feature set as its F300 EXR camera, the F550 EXR offers the company's latest 16Mp EXR CMOS sensor that allows full 1080p HD video recording and full-resolution 8fps continuous shooting. It includes the same 15x (24-360mm) optical zoom lens and 460K 3.0" LCD screen as the F300 EXR. The key differences between the F550 EXR and the F500 EXR (released at the same time) are the F550's GPS and RAW shooting capabilities.
