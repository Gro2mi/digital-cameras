ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: Arguably the first compact from Nikon that qualifies for the 'travel zoom' designation, the Coolpix S8000 offers a 10x zoom lens (30-300mm equivalent) in a very slim body. Announced in February, Nikon is trumpeting the S8000 as the   world's slimmest 10x zoom camera, and it certainly feels a lot more compact than most of the other models on the market, helped in no small part by the minimalist, smooth curves of the front plate. Apart from the lens, the S8000 offers an impressive set of features, including a 3in LCD screen with a class-leading resolution of 921k   dots. Unlike a DSLR, where pixel-level image quality is (arguably) fundamental to any assessment of how 'good' a camera is, the most   important parameters when looking at compact cameras are the speed and   accuracy of its key systems, and whether or not it is pleasant and easy to use. Going by these metrics, the S8000 is a very good compact camera, as long as you don't   need to look too closely at the images (or make huge prints).

    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: Novice photographers that want a slim, easy to use compact for small prints and web galleries.
        NotSoGoodFor: Experienced users that want more control over their images
        Conclusion: The Nikon Coolpix S8000 is pretty close to being an 'auto everything' camera, but this is no bad thing considering its target audience. Left to its own devides, the S8000 produces colorful, accurately exposed images in pretty much any environment. Its excellent LCD screen is also worthy of special mention.
