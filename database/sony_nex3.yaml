ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The NEX-3 mirrorless interchangeable lens camera is the smaller sister model of the NEX-5. Both NEX cameras come with a 14.6 megapixel Exmor APS HD CMOS and the mirrorless E-mount. They offer a high-resolution tilting screen, fast continuous shooting and HD video capture. The NEX-3 has a slightly larger plastic body (vs magnesium on the NEX-5), doesn't come with an infrared remote receiver and only offers 720p HD video versus the NEX-5's 1080i AVCHD movie recording. However, in every other respect the NEX-3 is identical to the NEX-5. In iAuto mode the camera does a decent job for point-and-shoot users but where the NEX really shines is the PASM modes where you can take full advantage of the large, very capable sensor. The feature sets are impressive, as are the NEX's portability and flexibility. The NEX is not a substitute for a DSLR but offers DSLR image quality without the bulk.

    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: Gadget lovers, Panoramics, Enthusiast photographers wanting APS-C image quality in a tiny package.
        NotSoGoodFor: Fast action shooting.
        Conclusion: The NEX-3 is a brave and interesting attempt to make a true crossover camera for compact camera users wanting access to a larger sensor and interchangeable lenses. And, although it isn't a flawless point-and-shoot camera, it offers a great feature set at a competitive price in a conveniently small body.
