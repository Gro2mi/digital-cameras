ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: With the 18MP EOS 60D Canon has unashamedly moved the X0D range out of the 'semi pro' bracket and instead focused on the enthusiast photographer looking to upgrade from their Rebel. From a spec and feature point of view it sits almost exactly half-way between the EOS 550D and the EOS 7D. Key features include an articulated LCD screen, a 18MP CMOS sensor, an ISO span of ISO 100-3200 (expandable to 12,800) and 1080p movie mode.

    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: Enthusiast photographers beginning to outgrow their first DSLR. Videographers wanting control over their footage.
        NotSoGoodFor: Demanding users who need the greater speed, sophistication and durability of a semi-pro grade camera.
        Conclusion: The 60D is probably best understood as a 'super Rebel.'  It's a more comfortable, more flexible, and faster-to-use version of Canon's justly popular entry-level DSLRs. The twin dial controls, better grip, and bigger viewfinder will delight stills shooters while the articulated screen and movie control will please would-be videographers.
