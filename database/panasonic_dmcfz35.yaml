ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ35/FZ38 super-zoom is amongst the first to feature AVCHD lite format  HD video recording. Successor to the DMC-FZ28, it features an 18x optical zoom lens (27- 486mm equiv.), Power O.I.S image stabilizer and a faster Venus Engine HD processor. The 12.1 MP camera also features a Quick AF system that claims to be two times faster than that of the DMC-FZ28.

    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: Photographers who want a take-anywhere superzoom that performs well and responsively in most situations
        NotSoGoodFor: Photographers who require extreme zoom ranges
        Conclusion: The FZ35 offers a good feature set and performs very well in all areas. If you can live with its (for this class of camera) relatively moderate 18x zoom range you can't go wrong with the Panasonic.
