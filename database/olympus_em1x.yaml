ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The Olympus OM-D E-M1X is the company's sports-oriented Micro Four Thirds camera that's all about speed. It has a 20.4MP Four Thirds sensor, Dual TruePic VIII processors, a 121-point hybrid autofocus system with intelligent subject detection for trains, race cars and planes/helicopters. The camera can shoot continuously at 60 fps with AF/AE lock and 18 fps with continuous AF/AE. The E-M1X offers a High Res Shot mode for both handheld and tripod use, a Live ND filter (using multiple exposures) and a Pro Capture mode that lets you save images taken before the shutter release button.The camera has a built-in battery grip (which holds two batteries), 5-axis image stabilization rated to 7 stops, a large electronic viewfinder, fully articulating touchscreen LCD, dual SD card slots and a built-in GPS with temperature, pressure and acceleration sensors. The body is weather-sealed to IPX1 standards.The OM-D E-M1X can capture both DCI (24p) and UHD 4K (30p) video at bit rates of 237 and 102 Mbps, respectively. High speed video capture at 1080/120p and OM-Log400 for easier color grading are also available.

    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: Current Micro Four Thirds shooters who want a twin grip camera to photograph fast-moving subjects.
        NotSoGoodFor: Anyone not already heavily-invested in Micro Four Thirds glass. Those seeking a small, light camera.
        Conclusion: The E-M1X is the only twin-grip Four Thirds camera on the market squarely aimed at pros - it's large, fast and tough-built. But its price tag puts it in a tricky position, as plenty of other larger-sensor cameras can be had for considerably-less coinage - many even offer more reliable AF.
