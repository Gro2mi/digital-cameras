ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The LX7 is Panasonic's latest 'enthusiast' compact, and its 24-90mm equivalent, F1.4-2.3 lens is the fastest yet seen on this type of camera. This is combined with 1/1.7" type 10.1 MP MOS sensor that offers an ISO range of 80-12800. Full resolution burst shooting with continuous AF is available at up to 5.5 frames per second, and up to 11 frames per second with focus locked. The LX7 can also record Full HD 60p/50p video, and has built-in stereo microphones.The LX7 offers a full set of manual exposure modes, with an aperture ring around the lens to offer quick control over that shooting parameter. There are numerous ways to adjust white balance to your liking in-camera, and three different bracketing modes are provided. Creative Control mode adds sixteen different special effects into the mix, rounding out a very strong portfolio of in-camera shooting and processing options.

    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: Low light enthusiasts who desire a camera with manual controls, fast performance, expandability, and a top-notch movie mode.
        NotSoGoodFor: Those planning on taking a lot of people pictures with the built-in flash - redeye will likely be an issue. Also, slow zoom speed can be very annoying.
        Conclusion: It wasn't easy to improve on the already impressive DMC-LX5, but Panasonic managed to pull it off with their new LX7. Enthusiasts will love its fast lens, manual controls, photo quality, and 1080/60p movie mode. Beginners can enjoy the LX7 too, thanks to Panasonic's great Intelligent Auto mode.
