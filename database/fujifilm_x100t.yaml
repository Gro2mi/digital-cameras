    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: Photographers wanting to engage with the shooting experience. Anyone looking for a relatively small, high-quality camera (with a bit of style). Shooters wanting beautiful images straight out-of-camera
        NotSoGoodFor: Fast-moving subjects. Pulling out the finest scene detail. Shooting video. Anyone needing to zoom.
        Conclusion: The X100T is an excellent photographic tool that's engaging to use and capable of beautiful images. Its autofocus is starting to show its age, and its unusual X-Trans sensor's benefits are hard to discern in an era of 24 and 28MP rivals. But there's currently nothing to touch it in terms of the size/price/image quality balance it offers and the style with which it does so.
