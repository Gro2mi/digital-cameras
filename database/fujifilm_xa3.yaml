ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The X-A3 is Fujifilm's entry-level mirrorless camera. It features a 24MP CMOS sensor, EXR Processor II and a contrast-detect AF system with your choice of 49 or 77 points. The main difference between it and Fujifilm's higher-end X-series models is that it uses a traditional Bayer color filter, rather than X-Trans. The X-A3 has a flip-up 3" touchscreen display that's perfect for selfies. It offers full manual exposure controls (plus numerous auto modes) as well as most of Fujifilm's well-known Film Simulation modes. Full HD video can be captured at 60p or 24p. Wi-Fi is built-in.

    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: Static subjects in good light, going out all day with one battery,
        NotSoGoodFor: Shooting anything moving and video capture (both due to AF system).
        Conclusion: Despite its impressive spec sheet, battery life and pleasant JPEG colors, the X-A3's sub-par AF system and overall sluggishness. For social shooters it's okay, but the bottom line is that better cameras in this price range exist.
