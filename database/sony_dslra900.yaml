ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: 'The DSLR-A900 is Sony''s full-frame flagship and a true photographer''s camera. It offers a great viewfinder, in-body image stabilization and, at the time of its launch, at 24.6 MP the highest nominal resolution of its class. The camera is capable of stunning results at up to ISO 400 (and is fine at ISO 800-1600 as long as you''re not printing posters), and it is incredibly fast and responsive in use. On the downside the performance at higher sensitivities is not quite up to par with the direct competition in this sector and, while the camera seemed like quite a bargain at its launch, other attractively priced full-frame cameras entered the market soon after. As a result the A900 probably struggled to make a serious impression on anyone other than the Sony/Minolta faithful. One thing is clear, however: anyone who thought a consumer electronics giant could not make a heavyweight photographic tool was seriously misguided.'
