    ExecutiveSummary: The LUMIX TS5 is rugged -- waterproof to 43 feet, shockproof from 6.5 feet, freezeproof from 14 degrees Fahrenheit, and pressure resistant to 220 lbs. New on offer is Near Field Communication (NFC), a close-proximity radio connection that the camera can use to initiate a Wi-Fi connection with a compatible device simply by tapping the two together, allowing remote shooting and sharing from a smartphone or tablet. It also has a Leica 28-128mm f/3.3-5.9 lens, 1080 HD video, and plenty of creative and automatic modes.

    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: Adventurous photographers looking for a rugged cameras with a great LCD, well-implemented GPS, and photo sharing via Wi-Fi. Video lovers will also appreciate the 1080/60p movie mode.
        NotSoGoodFor: Photographers planning on taking a lot of flash and low light photos.
        Conclusion: The Lumix DMC-TS5 is a good choice for those seeking a rugged camera with a robust feature set that includes a well-implemented GPS, plus Wi-Fi. The camera takes good quality photos for its class, has a great LCD, and offers a top-notch movie mode. However, its lens is on the slow side, and the flash is very weak. The Wi-Fi system could also be a lot more user-friendly.
