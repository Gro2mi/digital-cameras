    ExecutiveSummary: 'Manufacturer description: The OM-D E-M1 interchangeable lens camera is now the flagship of Olympus''s Micro Four Thirds lineup. Rather than calling it the follow-up to the E-M5, Olympus says that the E-M1 is actually the ''successor'' to the E-5, a Four Thirds DSLR introduced back in 2010. The E-M1''s 16.3-megapixel Live MOS sensor has on-chip 37-point phase detection, which allows the E-M1 to focus legacy Four Thirds lenses (using the optional MMF-3 adapter) at much faster speeds than previous Olympus m4/3 cameras. When you''re using Micro Four Thirds lenses, focusing is handled by the EM-1''s 81-point contrast detect AF system.The EM-1 is weather, dust, splash and freezeproof, with a large high resolution touch LCD and electronic viewfinder. It retains the E-M5''s built-in 5-axis image stabilization, plenty of customizable controls, and Wi-Fi image transfer and camera controls via Olympus''s Image Share 2.0 smartphone app.'

    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: Those who prefer viewfinder shooting, want a relatively compact system camera without sacrificing external controls of a DSLR.
        NotSoGoodFor: Sports and fast action demanding very fast burst rates, very low light, and users with little interest in customizing camera functions.
        Conclusion: In most respects the E-M1 does a good job bridging the gap between a traditional DSLR and a Micro Four Thirds camera. Its controls and customizability may overwhelm less hands-on users, but those who don't mind tinkering will love its flexibility. The improved autofocus tracking and performance with original Four Thirds lenses adds to the appeal of a camera with blazingly fast AF acquisition speeds with its native lenses.
