ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: Minor update to the DSC-H3 (adding a larger screen), the H10 is Sony's answer to Panasonic's popular TZ ('travel zoom') series and offers the same appealing combination of a long (10x) stabilized zoom and a surprisingly compact body. The design is a little 'love it or hate it' but image quality isn't bad at all and it's fun, easy and copes well with a wide range of shooting scenarios - though the lack of wideangle means there are more versatile competitors out there.  The H10 was superceded by the H20, which adds HD movie capture, more pixels and a larger screen.
