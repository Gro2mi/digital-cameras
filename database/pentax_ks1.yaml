ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The Pentax K-S1 is a uniquely styled midrange DSLR that features futuristic LED lights on its grip as well as a backlit mode dial on its rear. It uses a new 20MP CMOS sensor and Pentax's reliable SAFOX IX i+ autofocus system. As with all Pentax DSLRs, image stabilization is built into the body, and this shake reduction system can also be used to simulate an AA filter. Photos can be composed on a 3" LCD or large optical viewfinder. The K-S1 can shoot at 5.4 fps and records 1080p/30 video. Like many recent Ricoh cameras, the K-S1 will be available in multiple colors.
