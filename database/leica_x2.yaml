ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The Leica X2 is a 16MP APS-C compact camera with a fixed 36mm equivalent F2.8 lens. The camera is an updated version of its X1, with the biggest changes being the use of a 16.2MP CMOS sensor and the addition of an accessory socket for adding an optional 1.44M dot 'Viso-Flex' electronic viewfinder. An add-on handgrip is also available. Leica says it has improved the autofocus system (one of our biggest criticisms of the X1), but has retained the rather low-resolution 230,000 dot rear LCD. The optional Viso-Flex is visually near-identical to the Olympus VF-2 viewfinder, which uses a full 1.44m dot Epson LCD panel, rather than the Panasonic LVF2, which uses a field-sequential display (updating one color after another), to offer the equivalent of 1.44m dots.
