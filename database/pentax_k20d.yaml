ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: Strong mid-range showing from Pentax (developed in conjunction with Samsung) updates K10D with new 14.6 megapixel CMOS sensor, live view and improvements to the LCD and burst shooting - plus a host of feature tweaks and upgrades. The Pentax K20D could be seen as a K10D Mk2, a camera that attempts to move on while putting right the minor flaws in its predecessor. And in that respect, it's a huge success. The K20D builds on the strengths of its forebear and addresses our complaints about its image quality. It offers a great on-paper specification that is backed-up by a level of customization that allow you to tailor the camera to the way you want to shoot.
