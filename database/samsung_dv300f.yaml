ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The Samsung DV300F is a Wi-Fi compatible compact camera with a twin LCD 'DualView' feature. The DV300F has a 5x, 25-125mm equiv, F2.5-6.3 stabilized zoom lens and a 16MP CCD sensor. It also features a 1.5" LCD on its front plate to allow easy self-portraits. Its stand-out feature, though, is its Wi-Fi capability, that allows it to be remotely controlled from an Android smartphone (an iOS version is being developed). It can also automatically backup your images to your home computer via a Wi-Fi network, every time you walk into the house, or to a 'cloud' service such as Microsoft's SkyDrive or Samsung's All Share Play, avoiding the need to remove the camera's MicroSD card. The DV300F also includes a 'log-on browser' that allows its use with public WiFi hotspots that require you to log in.
