ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: 'Manufacturer description: The Casio Exilim EX-100 is a premium compact camera with a 10.7X, 28-300mm lens with constant F2.8 maximum aperture. A 5-axis image stabilization system helps reduce blur due to camera shake. It has a 1/1.7" CMOS sensor and Casio''s latest Exilim Engine. The camera has a unique ''dual bracketing'' feature that allows you to shoot nine images with different settings (exposure, white balance, saturation, contrast, focus, aperture). Photos can be composed on a giant 3.5" tilting LCD display, and settings can quickly be adjusted via a function ring around the lens. The EX-100 has full manual exposure controls, Raw support, a built-in ND filter, and Wi-Fi.  It can also record 1080/30p video with the ability to take still photos while filming.'
