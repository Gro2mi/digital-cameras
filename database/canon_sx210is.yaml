ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: Successor to the SX200IS, the Canon Powershot SX210 IS combines what might loosely be termed IXUS-inspired styling, with more conventional Powershot ergonomics. A metal body shell and semi-matte finish set it apart from Canon's lower-end offerings, and its stabilized 14x optical zoom is one of the most powerful of its competition. The SX210 IS's core features are well-implemented and the camera's key systems, like AF, WB and metering, are accurate and reliable. Our main frustrations with the SX210 IS are sub-par image quality when examined at 100% compared to the competition, and some strange and unwelcome ergonomic quirks that detract from the generally fluid handling.

    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: Point-and-shoot photographers that don't need to make large prints
        NotSoGoodFor: More critical users, and anyone on a budget.
        Conclusion: The Canon Powershot SX210IS is a very capable camera let down by soft images and a fussy interface. That said, for the point-and-shoot user looking for decent quality 6x4in prints wanting to create a web gallery, it's fine.
