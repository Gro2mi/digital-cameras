ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The Nikon 1 J2 presents some modest updates to its Nikon 1 J1 predecessor. Maintaining its entry-level feature set, it offers a 10.1MP CMOS sensor of the 1"-type, providing a 2.7x crop factor. Nikon has included a higher-resolution 920,000-dot LCD, an improvement to the J1, and a host of photo features like Smart Photo Selector and Motion Snapshot, a mode that creates a moving image file alongside a still image.
