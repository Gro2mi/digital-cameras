ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: Fujifilm claims that the FinePix XP30 was the world's first rugged compact with built-in GPS. Tougher than the previously released XP10, it is designed to be waterproof up to 5 meters, shockproof up to 1.5 meter and freezeproof to - 10 degrees. It features the same 2.7" LCD of the XP10, 5x optical zoom lens starting at a more useful 28mm and a 14Mp sensor compared to XP10's 12Mp CCD.

    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: Casual underwater photography for web sharing and small prints.
        NotSoGoodFor: Anywhere critical image or video quality is required.
        Conclusion: Although the Fuji XP30 matches many of the cameras in this class for basic 'rugged' compact camera specifications, it delivers below-average performance in image quality and speed of operation. Even so, with the lowest price of any waterproof camera released in 2011, it is an affordable and easy to use option for those on a budget.
