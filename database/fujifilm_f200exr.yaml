ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: With the F200 EXR, Fujifilm is out to regain its low-light crown, based its unique new 'switcheable' EXR sensor technology, which allow you to tune the sensor for different shooting conditions. Even without the EXR modes, the F200 is a nice and well-specified camera. It's built around a very useful lens (28-140mm is not a range you'll find matched by many cameras this small), and offers image quality at least up to the standards of its contemporaries. And the EXR modes are worth having - the high-ISO 'SN' mode may not be world-beating, but the dynamic range mode is astonishingly capable if you're happy with the 6MP output (which is plenty for most applications).
