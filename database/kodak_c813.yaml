ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: One of a handful of almost identical budget cameras from Kodak (this one has 8.2 megapixels, a 3x zoom and a low-resolution 2.4" screen). As with all EasyShare models the emphasis is on user-friendly ease of use, and digital cameras don't some much simpler than this. The specification is as basic as you'd expect for such a low price and though we've not tested this particular model, our experience of this range is that in good light the results are fine, but don't expect much shooting at night or with flash.
