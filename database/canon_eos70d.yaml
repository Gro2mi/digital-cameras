ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The EOS 70D is a mid-range SLR aimed squarely at enthusiast photographers. On the outside it looks little different to its predecessor the 60D, but on the inside it's a completely different camera. The 70D has an innovative 20.2MP 'Dual Pixel CMOS AF' sensor, promising hugely improved autofocus in live view and during movie recording. For shooting with the optical viewfinder it has a 19-point AF module borrowed from the EOS 7D. It's also packed full of Canon's latest technology, including full touchscreen control, built-in Wi-Fi for image sharing and remote camera control from your smartphone , 7 fps continuous shooting, and an ISO range of 100-12800 (25600 expanded).

    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: Almost any semi-pro shooting situation, from sports action to portraits, as well as video.
        NotSoGoodFor: Casual snapshooters on a budget; those who shoot neither live view nor video; photographers looking to travel light.
        Conclusion: Offering most of what an enthusiast looks for in a digital SLR, the Canon 70D takes it a step further with excellent live view and movie mode autofocus. Good continuous shooting performance and Wi-Fi simply serve to sweeten the deal.
