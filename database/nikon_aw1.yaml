ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The Nikon 1 AW110 is the world's first rugged mirrorless camera. The camera body is able to dive 15 meters underwater, be dropped from 2 meters, or be exposed to temperatures as low as +14F/-10C. Do note that only certain 1 System lenses will be able to hold up to those conditions. At the time of the AW1's release, the choices include the 11.0-27.5mm and 10mm F2.8 'AW' lenses. The AW1 sports a GPS receiver, along with an e-compass and altimeter/depth meter, so you'll be able to share where you took your photos.The AW1 features a 14.2 megapixel CX-format CMOS sensor and Nikon's latest Expeed 3A processor. Focusing is achieved via a hybrid contrast and phase detect system which, in combination with the AW1's processing power, allows for 15 fps continuous shooting with autofocus (with focus locked that number jumps to 60 fps).Other notable features include a 3-inch LCD, manual controls, scene auto selection, 1080p video recording, and optional Wi-Fi.
