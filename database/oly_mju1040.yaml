ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: Stylish but unremarkable ultra compact that - like most cameras like this - is a lot nicer to look at than it is to use. That said, the image quality isn't terrible, the camera is pretty responsive and git enerally offers reliable point and shoot functionality. Our biggest gripe is the poor low light focus, which means  evening flash shots taken at anything other than the widest zoom setting are a bit hit 'n' miss.
