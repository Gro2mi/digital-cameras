    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: Pentax users on a tight budget
        NotSoGoodFor: Absolute beginners or JPEG shooters
        Conclusion: Although the overall specification is pretty good for this level of camera, the K-m/K2000 struggles to stand out from the crowd given the mediocre JPEG quality and poorly implemented autofocus system.
