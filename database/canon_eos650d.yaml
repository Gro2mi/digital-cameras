ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The Canon EOS 650D/ Rebel T4i/ Kiss X6 is the an 18MP touch-screen DSLR with a sensor-based hybrid AF system for improved focus in movie and live view modes. The camera gains the all-cross-type 9-point AF sensor from the EOS 60D and can now shoot at 5fps. It also adds stereo mics for its Full HD video recording, which is available at 30, 25 and 24fps.For users moving up from compact cameras, the 650D offers a very significant increase in image quality and usability. Where the camera falters, unfortunately, is with AF performance in live view. Canon's new 'hybrid' AF system, while a step forward compared to previous contrast detect attempts, is a long way from what we've seen in other mirrorless models

    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: Users who find a touchscreen interface more welcoming than dials and buttons but still want the option to grow into more manual control over their photography.
        NotSoGoodFor: Users who need fast AF performance in live view or video mode.
        Conclusion: The Canon EOS 650D combines very good image quality with easy access to shooting parameters and extensive manual control. Its touchscreen interface brings a new level of operational efficiency to the DSLR market. Added to this is a fast 5 fps shooting rate and quick phase-detection AF.
