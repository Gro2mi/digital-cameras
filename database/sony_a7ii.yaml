ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The Sony Alpha 7 II is the follow-up to the original Alpha 7 and adds 5-axis sensor-shift image stabilization to its 24MP full-frame CMOS sensor. The a7 II continues to use a Hybrid AF system and it is 30% faster and 1.5X better than tracking compared to its predecessor. From a design standpoint, additional improvements in this model include more rugged build quality, a new front dial, and a relocated shutter release button.While the cameras can use any E-mount lens, there will be a crop factor involved (unless you don't mind vignetting). Sony is producing a new line of FE-series lenses that take advantage of the larger sensor.The A7 II continues to use the new Sony Bionz X processor, which produces images with better detail, less noise, and reduced diffraction. Other features include a 3-inch, tilting LCD, XGA OLED electronic viewfinder, Multi-interface (hot) shoe, Wi-Fi with NFC, and 1080/60p video recording - now with XAVC S and a 'flat' picture profile.

    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: Those seeking a well-priced, feature-packed full frame camera that can be used for both stills and video. Also third-party and adapted lens users who crave image stabilization.
        NotSoGoodFor: Fans of low light photography, sports shooters and street photographers seeking a quiet, small camera.
        Conclusion: The Alpha 7 II continues to push Sony's full frame mirrorless line of cameras into ground-breaking territory. It is the only full frame mirrorless camera to offer in-body image stabilization systems and its performance is excellent. The body is comfortable to shoot with and offers a broad set of features that should appeal to both still and video shooters. Unfortunately the a7 II's  high ISO image quality is not as good as other full framers. Raw files are also less malleable than the competition and JPEGs tend to suffer from aggressive noise reduction.
