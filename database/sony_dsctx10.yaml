ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The Cyber-shot DSC-TX10 rugged compact features Sony's latest 16.2 MP back-illuminated 'Exmor-R' CMOS sensor. Its dustproof, waterproof, shockproof and freezeproof body is available in bright colors. It is dustproof, waterproof up to depths of 5m (16 feet), shockproof against a drop of up to 1.5 meters (5 ft), and freezeproof down to -10 degrees C (14F). The stylish compact can record 1080i60 HD videos and also includes a useful HD output despite its small size. It is bundled with a 25-100mm equiv. wide-angle periscopic zoom lens and 3.0" touchscreen LCD. It includes Sony's 2011 features including Sweep Multi-Angle - a 3D shooting mode sweep that lets you view images moving in simulated 3D right on the TX10's display by tilting the camera back and forth and an HDR feature that compiles the highlights, mid-tones and shadows from three separate shots to create a single image with a wide dynamic range

    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: '''Go anywhere'' shooting - the TX10 is equally at home at a cocktail party and white-water rafting.'
        NotSoGoodFor: Quick 'in-depth' operation. The menu system is frustratingly hard to navigate with a sometimes unresponsive touchscreen.
        Conclusion: The Sony TX10 offers the widest feature set of all 'rugged' compact cameras released in 2011. It also boasts some of the best image quality and the best video quality in its class, performing especially well in low light situations. Unfortunately its rather clumsy touchscreen is required to control just about every aspect of the camera's operation.
