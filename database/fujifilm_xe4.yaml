    ExecutiveSummary: The Fujifilm X-E4 is a rangefinder-style mirrorless camera with a 26MP BSI-CMOS sensor paired with the company's exclusive X-Trans color filter. While has a "flatter" profile than its predecessors, there are still plenty of dials on the top plate. It has a 2.36M-dot electronic viewfinder as well as a flip-up touchscreen display.The X-E4 uses Fujfiilm's latest phase-detect AF system, which includes face and eye detection. It can shoot bursts at up to 20 fps with its electronic shutter and 8 fps with the mechanical shutter. The X-E4 has 18 Film Simulation modes available. It can also capture DCI 4K/30p video with a 200Mbps bit rate. High speed (200 fps) footage can be captured at Full HD resolution.

    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: Generalists looking for a capable and compact interchangeable lens camera. Street and travel photographers. Those wishing to shoot JPEGs only.
        NotSoGoodFor: Sports and action shooters needing the best AF performance. Video shooters needing in-body stabilization.
        Conclusion: The X-E4 is a stylish camera capable of excellent image quality and packed with useful features. It's the brand's smallest X-mount offering and a good choice for street, travel, and generalist photographers. It's also capable of strong video performance, though there's no in-body stabilization for hand-held shooting. The only thing the X-E4 doesn't excel at is AF tracking; you'll find quite a few of its competitors offer better tracking and face/eye detection.
