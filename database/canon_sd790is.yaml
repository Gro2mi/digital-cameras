ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: With its chiselled, slightly understated design, the SD790 IS / Ixus 90 is probably the best looking camera in Canon's current Elph lineup, and with its responsive operation and surprisingly good results it does exactly what a pocket camera should do; take great pictures with the minimum of fuss. It lacks any real standout features; from the 35-105mm zoom range to the boxy styling this is Canon playing it safe, resulting in a camera that sits firmly in the 'solid and reliable' camp. That's not a bad thing, and for those of us who place image quality far higher on our list of priorities the SD 790 IS doesn't disappoint.
