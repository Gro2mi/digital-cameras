    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: live view users, low light shooters, gadget lovers
        NotSoGoodFor: traditionalists, photographers who only use the optical viewfinder for framing
        Conclusion: The Sony DSLR-A580 is an excellent all-around performer but also offers a range of innovative features. It's a great alternative to more 'traditional' DSLRs, and Sony's unique dual live view system makes it the ideal compromise for those who like the option of shooting in live view but can't or don't want to live without an optical viewfinder.
