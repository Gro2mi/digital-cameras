ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The 12MP Panasonic DMC-GF5 mirrorless camera is a subtle revision over the GF3, with a higher-res screen, refined user interface and the option to shoot easier-to-edit MPEG 4 movies. It gains a handful of little changes, such as stereo microphones and an orientation sensor but, beyond its rubber grip, the changes are minor. Panasonic claims the 12MP sensor has been redesigned, so we wait to see whether the GF5's image quality can outshine its predecessor. The GF5 is available in a kit with the company's retractable Vario PZ 14-42mm power zoom lens, which combines to give probably the most pocketable way of achieving large-sensor image quality.
