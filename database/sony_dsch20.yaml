ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The  DSC-H20 is the third generation of Sony's unusually styled 10x zoom compact cameras and is, at least from the outside, very similar to its predecessors. Compared to the H10 the megapixel count has been  increased (from 8 to 10 MP) and the camera now also features 720p HD video capture and a slightly larger screen. However, the 10x zoom lens remains unchanged. Compared to most recent cameras in this class the H20's lens is biased far more towards the tele end, which is either a good thing or a bad thing depending on the type of thing you want to shoot. Image quality is pretty good but the lack of wideangle is disappointing.
