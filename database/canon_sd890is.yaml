ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: Announced in 2008, the SD890 IS (or IXUS 970 IS in Europe) boasts 10 million pixels in a 1/2.3 " (6.2 x 4.6 mm) sensor and an ISO 3200 mode. It also has a 5x zoom (the longest ever on the SD/IXUS series), covering a 37 - 185mm (equiv.) range which would be more impressive if it was a bit wider.
