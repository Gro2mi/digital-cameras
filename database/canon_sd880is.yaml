ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: Love them or hate them, Canon makes compact cameras that do exactly what they should; take good pictures in a range of conditions with the minimum of fuss. The SD880 IS (Ixus 870 IS) is an enjoyable camera to use, has a sensible range of features (including a nice 28-112mm wide zoom and a 3.0 inch screen) and - despite the relatively low pixel count - produces some of the best results in its class. It has more than a dash of style, is fast and responsive and small enough to carry with you anywhere you go.
