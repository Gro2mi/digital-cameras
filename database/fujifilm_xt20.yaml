ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The Fujifilm X-T20, the follow-up to the X-T10, now sports a 24MP X-Trans APS-C CMOS sensor, improved image processor, and new autofocus algorithms. The compact body is made of a magnesium alloy, and the top plate features direct controls for exposure compensation and shutter speed. On the back of the camera is a 3" touchscreen LCD as well as a high resolution electronic viewfinder. Other changes include the addition of the ACROS film simulation mode, Grain Effect and 4K video capture. Wi-Fi is built-in, as well.

    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: Photographers seeking a stylish camera with direct controls, excellent image quality and a great selection of lenses.
        NotSoGoodFor: Action photographers and those requiring ultra-high-quality 4K video.
        Conclusion: The Fujifilm X-T20 is a beautifully designed mirrorless camera that is a pleasure to use. It offers numerous direct controls, a high resolution EVF, snappy performance and excellent image quality. The X-T20's continuous AF system can struggle in low light, and subject tracking is inconsistent. 4K video quality isn't the greatest, and capture controls are limited. Despite that, the X-T20 is a first-rate mirrorless camera and a great value, to boot.
