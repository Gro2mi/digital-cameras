ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: Canon's second waterproof rugged camera, the 12MP D20 has a 5x, image stabilized 28-140mm equivalent zoom lens and features the company's latest 7-mode IS system. It also includes GPS and a 460,000 dot 3.0" LCD. The camera's back-lit CMOS sensor allows the D20 to shoot 1080p24 movies accessible with a dedicated movie record button. The D20 is waterproof to a depth of 10m and shockproof from a height of 1.5m.Overall, the PowerShot D20 offers a uniquely styled rugged body, good photo quality, and performance that'll satisfy its target audience. It wouldn't be our top choice for low light or movie recording, but for the photographer who will occasionally go underwater, the PowerShot D20 fits the bill.

    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: Photographers who want a compact camera that can go for a casual swim, hike, or diving trip.
        NotSoGoodFor: Low light and flash shooters, manual control lovers, and movie enthusiasts
        Conclusion: The PowerShot D20 is a good underwater camera, though it doesn't stand out in any particular area. It takes decent (though slightly soft) photos with pleasing colors (but expect a color cast when shooting underwater). Although light on features, the D20 is water, freeze, dust, and shockproof, and it didn't let us down in our testing.
