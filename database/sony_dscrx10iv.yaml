ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The Sony Cyber-shot DSC-RX10 IV is an enthusiast long zoom camera that improves upon its predecessor by adding a new image processor (the Bionz X from the a9), a hybrid AF system with 325 phase-detect points and 24 fps continuous shooting. It continues to use a 20MP 1"-type stacked CMOS sensor and 24-600mm equiv. F2.4-4 lens. Images can be composed on a new 3" tilting touchscreen LCD or the same OLED electronic viewfinder found on the RX10 III. The RX captures UHD 4K video without pixel binning to insure the best possible quality. It offers numerous capture tools, including S-Log2/3 support, gamma display assist, zebra and proxy recording. High frame rate video at up to 960 fps can also be recorded. Both mic and headphone jacks are built in.

    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: Casual sports, action and wildlife shooters. World travelers, family vacation photography, videographers looking for a high-quality all-in-one solution.
        NotSoGoodFor: Sports and action photographers wishing to zoom while also maintaining focus on a moving subject.
        Conclusion: The Sony RX10 IV is the ultimate 1" bridge camera. Its optically stabilized 24-600mm equiv. lens and 20MP sensor combine for outstanding image quality. And it is the first and only camera in its class with phase detect autofocus, which, when coupled with its lightning quick 24 fps maximum burst rate, makes it a formidable all-in-one for sports and action. But that's not all, its oversampled 4K video is top quality, and the camera offers a laundry list of video-making tools and features. Plus a touchscreen, redesigned menus and Bluetooth connectivity all contribute to a highly-spec'd, well-balanced camera.
