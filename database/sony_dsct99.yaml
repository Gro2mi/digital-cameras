ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The tiny Sony Cyber-shot DSC-T99 features the same lens and body design as the TX9, but has a smaller LCD screen and a 14MP CCD sensor that cannot achieve the fast multi-shot shooting required for Superior Auto mode. Like the TX9 and WX5 the T99 also features a Soft Skin mode that is designed to smooth out wrinkles and other blemishes from the subject's skin.
