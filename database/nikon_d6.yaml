ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The Nikon D6 is a professional DSLR designed for sports and action photography. It features a full-frame 20 Megapixel CMOS sensor and Nikon's most advanced autofocus system, as of February 2020. The AF system has 105 points, all of which are cross-type and use a 'triple-sensor arrangement'. Nikon claims that the D6 can focus down to -4.5EV. The camera can shoot bursts at up to 14 frames per second with continuous autofocus.As one would expect, the D6 has an incredibly durable, weather-sealed body. It has two XQD/CFexpress card slots along with Gigabit Ethernet, USB 3.2 and Wi-Fi + Bluetooth.
