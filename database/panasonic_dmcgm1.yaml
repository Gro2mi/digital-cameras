ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The Panasonic Lumix DMC-GM1 is a tiny Micro Four Thirds camera that can literally fit in the palm of your hand. It features the same 16 megapixel Live MOS sensor as the much larger GX7, and also sports a 3-inch touchscreen LCD, a wide selection of manual controls and creative features, 1080/60i movie recording, and built-in Wi-Fi.

    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: Street shooting, casual portraits, moderately low light.
        NotSoGoodFor: Fast action, telephoto shooting, very low light.
        Conclusion: The GM1 offers many of the features and image quality of its Lumix GX7 sibling in a much smaller, lighter package. A few concessions have been made to reduce the size so drastically, namely a lower-capacity battery, but it's an excellent option for casual shooting.
