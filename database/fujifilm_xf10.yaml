    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: Street photographers using 'snap focus', landscape shooters looking for a lightweight photographic companion and generalist photographers that have enough experience to work around the camera's limitations.
        NotSoGoodFor: Shooters that require consistently accurate autofocus, those looking to capture unexpected decisive moments and those who already have the latest smartphones that - in most cases - will be good enough.
        Conclusion: The Fujifilm XF10 takes great photographs and looks great doing it, but has too many caveats for us to wholeheartedly recommend. Overall operation is sluggish and autofocus just isn't reliable, which is unforgivable at this point considering how capable smartphones have become. But the lens is sharp, the sensor excellent and the colors gorgeous. In short, the XF10 can provide you with beautiful results, but you better pack your patience.
