ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The Cybershot DSC-T300 is the second generation of touch-screen ultra compacts from electronics giant Sony. Thanks to some clever folded optics Sony has managed to cram a non-protruding 5x (33-165mm equiv) zoom into the slimline body, which is also packed full of the latest special modes and functions, including 'smile shutter,' that only takes a photo once your subject is smiling. The real stand-out feature of this camera is the huge, 16:9 aspect ratio touch screen that covers the entire reverse of the body.Image quality is fine for smaller prints, though you won't want to use the high ISO settings too often. Now superceded by the DSC-T500 (more pixels but otherwise very similar)
