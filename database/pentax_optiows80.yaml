ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: More of a lifestyle camera, the waterproof WS80 it is not quite as resilient as its sister model, the W80 (though is still certified to depths of up to 1.5 meters for two hours). The 10MP camera features a Super Protect coating on its 35-175mm zoom lens. It also has a 2.7 inch LCD and offers interval shooting, HD video recording and a digital panorama mode.
