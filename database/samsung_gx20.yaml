ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: Successor to the GX-10, the GX-20 is a Samsung-branded version of the well-respected Pentax K20D mid-range digital SLR.  Essentially it's the same camera with a very slightly different body design, different menus and - according to Samsung - it's own JPEG processing. Key changes over the GX-10; 14.6 megapixel CMOS sensor (jointly developed, manufactured by Samsung), live view and a larger 2.7 inch LCD.
