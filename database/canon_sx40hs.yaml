ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The Canon PowerShot SX40 HS is a 12MP CMOS-based superzoom with 35x zoom. The SX40 steps into the place of the SX30 and offers a 24-840mm equivalent zoom range. It can shoot at up to 10.3 frames per second for 8 shots and can capture 1080p24 HD video. An 'Intelligent IS' system attempts to assess the shooting conditions and use the most appropriate stabilization mode, to make the camera's huge lens range usable.
