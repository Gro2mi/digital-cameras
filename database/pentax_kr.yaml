ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The K-r is Pentax's latest mid-level DSLR. Initially sitting above the K-x in the range it offers more angular, K-7-esque styling. It offers 6 fps continuous shooting and HD movie recording and regains AF-point illumination in the viewfinder. It also features a high-res 920k dot (VGA) LCD display and the ability to shoot at up to ISO 25600. Unusually for a Pentax at this level it uses an rechargeable Lithium Ion battery pack but can be used with AAs via an optional adapter.

    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: Beginners looking for a well-specified and affordable camera, low light (high ISO) work
        NotSoGoodFor: Movies, Auto-mode shooting
        Conclusion: A very competent upper entry-level camera that delivers decent image quality across the ISO range, and at six frames per second, comes with one of the fastest continuous shooting rates in its class. There's some stiff competition in the upper entry-level bracket of the market but the K-r is definitely worth a look.
