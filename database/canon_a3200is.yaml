ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: Canon  introduced the PowerShot A3300 IS and A3200 IS at CES 2011. Similar to their predecessors (the A3000 IS and A3100 IS), the latest duo are powered by Lithium-Ion rechargeable batteries. The A3300 features a 16Mp sensor and 3.0" LCD while the A3100 IS comes with a 14Mp sensor and 2.7" LCD. Both share wider-angle 28-140mm equiv. image-stabilized zoom lenses (compared to the 35-140mm lenses on the cameras they replaced), and upgraded video from VGA to 720p HD recording with H.624 compression.
