ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The Olympus VR-330 compact superzoom is one amongst the pair of the first VR series of affordable compacts. It features a 24-300mm equiv. zoom lens, 14MP sensor and includes features such as 720p HD recording, image stabilization, the company’s Magic filters and an HD output.  There is also a 3D mode which merges two consecutively shot images, where the second image is taken from a slightly different perspective. The data is processed in-camera resulting in an .MPO file, the universal industry 3D format for easy display on 3D televisions or laptops.
