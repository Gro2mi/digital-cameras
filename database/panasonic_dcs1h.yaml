ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The Panasonic Lumix DC-S1H is a video-centric full-frame mirrorless camera. Sharing a similar design as the S1 and S1R, this camera will be able to capture video at 6K/24p (3:2 aspect ratio), 5.9K/30p (16:9) and 10-bit 4K/60p. It features a V-Log/V-Gamut that can capture around 14 stops of dynamic range which, along with color and skin tones, is virtually the same as the company's professional VariCam. The S1H has no recording limit for any of its video modes.In addition to the twelve lenses on Panasonic's L-mount roadmap, EF and PL-mount adapters will allow the use of additional lenses.

    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: Productions and production teams requiring a small, affordable camera with impressive quality
        NotSoGoodFor: Run-and-gun shooting requiring perfect autofocus. Enthusiasts looking to dabble in video
        Conclusion: The S1H brings the features and feel of Panasonic's GH series to the L-mount full-frame system. It's a compact and affordable package if judged according to the standard of its broadcast-grade footage. The rolling shutter figures are worth being conscious of, and the autofocus isn't as impressive as the rest of the camera, but overall it's a superb video tool that will address a wide range of needs.
