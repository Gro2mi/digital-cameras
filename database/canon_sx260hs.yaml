ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The PowerShot SX260 HS is a GPS-enabled 20x compact superzoom with a 25-500mm equivalent lenses featuring the company's latest 7-mode image stabilization system. It features a 460k dot screen and the ability to shoot burst of images at 10.3 frames per second. It uses a 12MP back-lit CMOS sensor.All things considered, the PowerShot SX260 HS is a solid choice for those looking for a travel zoom camera. It's not particularly fast (especially in the AF department), nor is it loaded with bells and whistles like landmark databases. The bottom line is that the SX260 gets the job done in nearly all situations, and produces photos of higher quality than competitive models.

    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: Photographers looking for a GPS-equipped compact travel zoom that produces good quality photos (even in low light), and offers a nice set of both point-and-shoot features and manual controls.
        NotSoGoodFor: Photographers who take a lot of flash people pictures or want to capture fast action. Enthusiasts will be disappointed by the lack of RAW support, manual controls in movie mode, and a fixed ISO when shutter speeds are slow.
        Conclusion: Canon's PowerShot SX260 HS is a well-designed compact travel zoom that produces photos that hold up well against the competition. It has a solid set of features for the point-and-shoot crowd, though serious photographers may find some annoyances. The SX260 isn't the most responsive camera out there, but as long as you avoid fast-moving subjects, it'll serve you well.
