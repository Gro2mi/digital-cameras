ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: Upgrade to the popular FZ8 increases the zoom  to a staggering 18x, covering a hugely versatile 28-504mm (equiv.) range, adds a few new features (including Intelligent Auto) and ups the pixel count to 8.3 MP. The result is a hugely rewarding camera with an awful lot to recommend it despite a handful of question marks over the pixel-level image quality. Certainly one of the best cameras in its class.
