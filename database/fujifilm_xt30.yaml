ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The Fujifilm X-T30 provides many of the features found in the higher-end X-T3, including its 26.1MP X-Trans sensor and X-Processor 4 Quad Core-CPU. It offers a hybrid AF system with 425 points across the entire frame, and boasts faster face detection compared to its X-T20 predecessor.The X-T30 is an altogether smaller and lighter camera than the X-T3 (383 g / 13.5 oz compared to 539 g / 19 oz) and offers a smaller, lower-resolution viewfinder. A 3" 1.04M-dot touchscreen tilts on one axis, and a single card slot is offered. Burst shooting with continuous AF tops out at 20 fps (8 fps with mechanical shutter) and a lower native ISO of 160 is offered.

    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: Those seeking a lightweight camera with great out-of-camera image quality, flexible Raw files and top-notch video
        NotSoGoodFor: Those seeking best face and eye AF performance. Serious videographers who need the very best spec.
        Conclusion: The Fujifilm X-T30 is an exceptional value for the money, offering excellent image quality, a (generally) well-designed body with plenty of direct controls, and an autofocus system that handles most situations with ease, with face detection being a weak point. Video is a real highlight, in terms of both quality and controls, and offers features previously found on more expensive cameras. All-in-all, it's hard to go wrong with the X-T30, one of the best midrange cameras we've tested in a long time.
