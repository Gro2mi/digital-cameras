ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The Hasselblad X1D is a compact mirrorless medium-format camera. It uses a 50MP CMOS sensor (43.8 x 32.9mm), which the company says captures 14 stops of dynamic range. The camera offers a top ISO of 25600, an x-sync speed of 1/2000 sec and burst shooting at around 2 fps. Photos can be composed on a 3" touchscreen LCD or an electronic viewfinder with 2.36M dots. The X1D has dual SD memory card slots, audio in/out jacks, Wi-Fi and GPS, and USB 3.0. Video can be captured at 1080/25p. The camera supports Hasselblad's new XCD lenses and can use H-mount lenses via an adapter.

    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: High resolution work, especially with strobes.
        NotSoGoodFor: Moving subjects.
        Conclusion: The X1D is capable of some very impressive image quality but any advantage over its rivals isn't commensurate with the price premium it demands. It's a small and powerful system but its autofocus, while precise, is slow enough to limit its range of applications.
