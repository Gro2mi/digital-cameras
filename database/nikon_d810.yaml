ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The Nikon D810 is a full-frame digital SLR that features 36.3 megapixel FX-format CMOS sensor (without an optical low-pass filter) along with Nikon's latest EXPEED 4 image processing engine. The EXPEED 4 improves performance and image quality and also offers an ISO range of 64 to 12800, which expands to 32 to 51200. There's also a new RAW Small Size option, which produces 16MP images with much smaller file sizes. The shutter mechanism has been redesigned and a first curtain electronic shutter added in order to reduce the risk of 'shutter shake'. On the video front, the D810 offers full HD recording at 1080/60p/24p with manual exposure control, focus peaking and zebra pattern, manual exposure control, and audio level adjustment. New features include uncompressed HDMI output with simultaneous recording to a memory card, a new 'flat' Picture Control (designed with post-production in mind), highlight weighted metering, and Auto ISO in manual mode.

    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: Landscape and studio photographers who need resolution and dynamic range, and enthusiast shooters who want an 'everything' camera without spending flagship money.
        NotSoGoodFor: Low light work is hampered by poor AF responsiveness and mirror-induced vibrations can reduce resolution in telephoto images with VR activated.
        Conclusion: The Nikon D810 is one of the best-rounded DSLRs we've ever tested, and as a camera that we've lived and worked with for almost two years, we're confident that it will remain relevant - and useful - for many years to come. The D810 offers medium format-esque dynamic range at ISO 64, and more than enough resolution for almost any application. Its well thought-out ergonomics, build and speed make it as versatile in the field as in the studio. We do have some reservations - mirror and shutter shock can still be an issue in some situations, particularly in combination with VR lenses, and we wish focus was more reliable in low light - but these do not detract unduly from the quality of the total package.
