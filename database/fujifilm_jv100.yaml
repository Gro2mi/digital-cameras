ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: Fujifilm's JV series are intended to appeal to style - as well as budget - conscious photographers. Available in five colors (varying by territory) the metal-bodied JV100 certainly cuts a dash that belies its low pricepoint. As far as specification is concerned, the JV100's 12MP CCD sensor isn't worth getting too excited about, and neither is its 3x optical zoom, which starts at 37mm and tops out at 111mm. On the plus side, the JV100 does offer a 720p video mode, as well as the usual rash of scene modes, face detection, blink detection and Scene Recognition Auto.
