ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: Successor to the 350D, the EOS 400D (Rebel XTi) was another big seller for Canon, and can still be found on sale if you look hard enough. The headline changes - more megapixels, sensor cleaning, improved AF system and larger screen come along with a slew of smaller (but often significant) enhancements, but the truth is that for many the EOS 400D was a relatively disappointing upgrade to its hugely successful predecessor. Image quality is excellent, and the user interface improvements welcome, but the handling and feature set didn't (and still don't) compete that well with competitor models.
