    ExecutiveSummary: 'Manufacturer description: Built around a 24 MP APS-C sensor, hybrid autofocus, and a continuous shooting speed up to 11FPS, the Sony a6000 promises the shooting style and image quality of a DSLR in a compact package. The a6000 adopts the same gapless on-chip lens structure as the a7R and features a new-generation RGB color filter (first introduced on this model). Sony says that this technology will significantly increase light collecting efficiency. The top-mounted control dial and rear-mounted control wheel allow quick settings that vary depending on the shooting mode (including exposure, ISO and WB). In addition, there is a Fn (function button) and seven customizable buttons, including two dedicated custom buttons which can be assigned any of 47 functions.'

    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: Anyone looking to shoot stills and video. Photographers wanting something small but capable. Amateur sports shooters.
        NotSoGoodFor: Shooters used to a twin-dial camera. Anyone looking to just use the kit zoom.
        Conclusion: The a6000 brings Sony's latest interface improvements and enhanced JPEG processing to a well-featured, competitively-priced mid-range camera. Its stand-out features are its comprehensive video controls and continuous autofocus performance unprecedented at this price. The flexible but optically average power zoom make this a highly capable and compact package.
