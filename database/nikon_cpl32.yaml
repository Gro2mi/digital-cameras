ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: 'Manufacturer description: The L32 is a model that offers simple operation and superior image quality with an effective pixel count of 20.1-million pixels and a 5x optical zoom NIKKOR lens that covers a broad range of focal lengths, from the wide-angle 26mm to the telephoto 130mm (equivalent angles of view in 35mm [135] format). The 3-inch, approximately 230k-dot TFT LCD monitor with anti-reflection coating built into the camera ensures clear viewing with both shooting and image playback. In addition, the camera is equipped with a Glamour Retouch function (offering 8 effects) that allows users to create memorable portraits with the addition of a variety of effects to the faces of human subjects after photos are taken.'
