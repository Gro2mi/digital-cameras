ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The Olympus E-5 replaces the E-3 at the top of its DSLR line. Almost three years after launching its predecessor, the company has refreshed its professional flagship to reflect the features of its latest E-series and Micro Four Thirds cameras. The E-5 is built around the weather-sealed body of the E-3 and offers a 12Mp Live MOS sensor, 3.0" 920k LCD, Live View with Contrast AF, HD video recording and shutter speeds of up to 1/8000th sec.

    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: Low ISO, bright light shooting, and working in tough conditions
        NotSoGoodFor: Anything where speed, dynamic range or high ISO image quality are critical
        Conclusion: The E-5 isn't meant to appeal to the mass market, and we suspect that it won't. However, as a flagship for the established Four Thirds system, it succeeds brilliantly. The E-5 is capable of excellent results, and its tank-like body should take years of abuse. Unfortunately, comparably poor image quality at high ISO settings, and restricted dynamic range make it less competitive than it could be.
