ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The TL34 HD (or NV100 HD as it is known in Europe) is the new flagship of Samsung's NV range, offering high resolution (14.7 MP), a wide zoom lens and a wealth of features. With its sleek design and touch-screen user interface it appears to be aimed at the gadget loving technophile, but looking at its spec sheet it's clearly got a lot to offer to more serious photographers as well. Unfortunately the image quality is poor (it may have almost 15 megapixels, but the output would be unimpressive for an 8MP camera) and it's frustratingly slow in use.
