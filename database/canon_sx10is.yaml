ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The SX10 IS was a relatively subtle evolution of the S5 IS, and Canon didn't exactly break new ground here, but it addressed several of the key concerns we had with the SX10's predecessor (the lack of a wideangle lens, annoying SD card slot in the base, mediocre electronic viewfinder), and the result was a camera that upped the ante in this competitive sector of the market. In terms of image quality we found the SX10 to deliver excellent metering, bright but natural color and good edge to edge detail across the zoom range at lower ISO settings. Like all the cameras in this class the high ISO output was considerably less impressive, though it was one of the better performers at ISO 400-800.
