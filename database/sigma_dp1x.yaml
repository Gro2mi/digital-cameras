ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: Yet another revised version of Sigma's DP1 large-sensor compact camera, the DP1x features the same sensor and wide angle lens as the DP1, but inherits the faster True II processor from the DP2 and a new AF algorithm for faster auto focus. It also shares the revised rear design of the DP2s, with a dedicated 'QS' (Quick Set) button and more visible labeling of controls.
