ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The Nikon D5500 is a midrange DX-format that sports a 24MP CMOS sensor with no optical low-pass filter (OLPF) and the company's latest EXPEED 4 processor. This combination offers an ISO range of 100-25600 and 5 fps burst shooting, while the 39-point AF system can track subjects in '3D'. Other features include a fully articulating 3.2" touchscreen LCD with 1.04M dots, 1080/60p video, and a new 'flat' picture mode designed for post-production. The body is one of Nikon's most compact and weighs just 14.8 oz (420 g).

    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: Anyone seeking a lightweight, portable DSLR that can serve both point-and-shoot and advanced users. Videophiles who will appreciate a touch LCD and broad feature set.
        NotSoGoodFor: Those who frequently shoot bursts of Raw images, want full control from their smartphone, or prefer twin dial operation.
        Conclusion: The D5500 is a compact, lightweight, and very competent DSLR. Its image quality and continuous AF is impressive, feature set is broad, and performance is strong. It's not great for continuous Raw shooting and the lack of a second control dial may put off some enthusiasts, but overall the D5500 is well worth considering.
