ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The Fujifilm FinePix S2500HD  is a lightweight, DSLR-styled superzoom compact camera with a 12MP image-stabilized sensor, and wide angle 18x optical zoom lens starting at 28mm. The S2500HD features a 3 inch LCD screen, and an electronic viewfinder. Along with its peers, the S1600 and S1800, the S2500HD also features HD video recording, with HD output. The S2500HD is one of the cheapest cameras in its class but in our testing we have found that in most areas it's also the worst performer. While you would expect a slightly more modest feature set from a camera that is targeted at the budget-conscious user, the inconsistent exposure and and other image quality issues are more serious. The S2500HD's automatic systems aren't reliable enough and require manual intervention more often than we would like.

    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: Photographers on a very tight budget who want the smallest possible superzoom camera
        NotSoGoodFor: low light shooting, anything that requires snappy operation and/or reliable focus and exposure
        Conclusion: The S2500 is the cheapest camera in this test but also in most areas the weakest performer. It's by no means terrible but there are simply better alternatives available.
