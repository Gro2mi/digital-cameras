ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: Samsung has been pushing the idea of an all-in-one 'Personal Media Player' (PMP) / camera for several years now. The CL5's funky design and range of bold color options can't hide the fact that it's a budget 9MP camera with basic MP3 and MPEG movie playback functionality. Great for teens; the rest of us would be better paying for a proper camera and leaving the media playing to a dedicated device. (April 2009).
