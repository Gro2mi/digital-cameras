ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: Sitting at the top of the Coolpix 'S' (Style) range, the S710 is packed with pixels (14.5 million of em) and features - including full photographic control, useful 28-101mm (equiv.) zoom and a large 3.0" LCD screen. First impressions are very positive (great styling and build quality, comprehensive features), but once you turn it on things start to go awry, with sluggish operation, pedestrian image quality and less than perfect metering, white balance, flash and focus. It's not a terrible camera by any measure, but it's not worth its premium price.
