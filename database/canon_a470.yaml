ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The PowerShot A470 is the latest in a long line of entry-level A series cameras and is currently the least expensive model in Canon's extensive compact lineup. Being the bottom of the range means the A470 misses out on optical image stabilization (now found on virtually all Canon PowerShots), and the 3.4x zoom lens starts at a rather uninspiring 38mm equivalent, but you still get the benefit of the DIGIC III processor, giving you fast, effective face detection, AiAF multi point focus and motion detection (which is designed to avoid blur by increasing the ISO when it detects movement in the scene).The feature set may be fairly basic but what it does do, it does well - helped by Canon's clean, easy to use menu system and the excellent FUNC menu. Despite the low price the PowerShot A470 scored well on image quality in our tests, and if you can live with the rather uninspired styling and slow flash recycling it offers superb value for money. Recently superceded by the A480.
