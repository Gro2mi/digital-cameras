ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The Coolpix P80 comes with a 10.1 MP sensor and a whopping 18x zoom (27-486mm equiv) which should hardly ever let you run out of focal length. There are also a 2.7" LCD screen and a CCD-shift image stabilization system. Unfortunately, sub-par image quality, unreliable AF and a cramped viewfinder let it down.
