ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The GoPro Hero 7 Silver launched alongside the higher-spec'd Black and budget-oriented White editions. The Hero 7 Silver features 4K/30p video recording, built-in GPS and 10MP stills. It uses a built-in rather than removable lithium-ion battery, and lacks the super slow-motion video modes offered by the Hero 7 Black.
