ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The Sony Cyber-shot WX500 is, at the time of its release, the world's smallest superzoom camera (along with its sibling, the HX70V). It features a 30X zoom equivalent to 24-720mm, optical image stabilization, and an 18.2MP BSI CMOS sensor. Photos can be composed on a 3" LCD that tilts upward 180 degrees. Also borrowed from the RX100 is a customizable ring around the front of the lens. The HX90V can record video at 1080/60p using the XAVC S codec, which allows for bit rates up to 50MBps. The camera also has built-in Wi-Fi with NFC with downloadable apps.
