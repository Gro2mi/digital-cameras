ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: 'Manufacturer description: Developed as the successor to the award winning Pentax K-3, the new K-3 II shares its predecessor’s magnesium alloy casing, metal chassis, 24.35 effective megapixel resolution, 27-point AF system and approximately 8.3 frames per second shooting while adding an improved 4.5EV stop shake reduction system, new high-speed AF algorithm, GPS, gyro sensor panning detection and automatic horizon correction.The K-3 II is the first camera in the PENTAX line to incorporate Pixel Shift Resolution for capturing still life subjects with ultra-high resolving power. Pixel shift technology uses the camera’s in-body Shake Reduction mechanism to move the image sensor at single pixel increments, capture 4 separate images, which are subsequently combined into a single high definition image.  Benefits include higher resolving power, reduced false color and improved overall image quality of non-moving subjects.'
