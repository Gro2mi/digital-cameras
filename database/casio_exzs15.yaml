ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The Exilim EX-ZS15 is a touch-screen compact with a 5x wide-angle zoom. The 14MP CCD-based camera features a 26-130mm equivalent lens and 3" touch-sensitive display. The touch-screen display not only includes a touch-shutter mode but also replaces virtually all the camera's buttons, leaving just a shutter, video record, Best Shot Selector and power buttons. Beyond this the camera can shoot 720p30 video.
