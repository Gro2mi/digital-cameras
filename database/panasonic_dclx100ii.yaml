ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The Panasonic DC-LX100 II is an enthusiast compact with a 17MP Four Thirds sensor that allows the camera to maintain the same field-of-view at 16:9, 3:2 and 4:3 aspect ratios. The LX100 II uses the same 24-75mm equivalent F1.7-2.8 Leica DC lens and shares the same design, including dials for shutter speed and exposure compensation, plus a ring for adjusting the aperture. A custom control ring can also be found around the lens. The LX100 II has a 1.24M-dot touchscreen LCD and 2.76M-dot equivalent electronic viewfinder. The camera can shoot continuously at 5.5 fps with continuous autofocus or 11 fps with AE/AF lock. As before, the LX100 II can capture UHD 4K video, which also allows for 4K Photo, Post Focus and Sequence Composition features. It has Panasonic's latest Picture Styles, including the high-contrast L.Monochrome D mode, to which a random grain effect can be added.The LX100 II has built-in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, with the latter maintaining a constant connection that allows for quick remote control and auto image transfer.

    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: Enthusiasts looking for an enjoyable always-with-them tool
        NotSoGoodFor: Anyone needing something truly pocketable
        Conclusion: The LX100 II is a small, engaging enthusiast compact. Its bright 24-75mm equivalent lens and multi-aspect design make it highly flexible. Only the cropped video and slightly basic viewfinder stop this lightly-refreshed camera reasserting itself as a clear leader in this class.
