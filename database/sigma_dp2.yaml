ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The DP2 is Sigma's second camera to feature a large, DSLR-sized, sensor in a compact body. It offers a 41mm equivalent fixed focal-length lens with a relatively fast maximum aperture of F2.8. It also features Sigma's Foveon sensor that records red, green and blue wavelengths of light at each of its photosites (as opposed to conventional, 'Bayer' designs that record either red,&nbsp; or green, or blue at each point). The camera is aimed at keen enthusaist photographers and offers a great deal of manual control and no automated scene modes.
