ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: 'Panasonic''s GX9 is a 20MP interchangeable lens Micro Four Thirds camera. Its sensor does not use a low-pass filter in an effort to maximize sharpness, and an L/Monochrome D Photo Style is included for fans of black-and-white film. The GX9 does not offer weather-sealing, unlike the GX8 and G9.The GX9 offers a 2.7 million-dot (equiv) EVF that tilts 90° upward, and a 1.2 million-dot touchscreen that tilts up 80° and down by 45° – a departure from the G9 and GX8''s fully articulated screens. An electromagnetic drive claims to reduce shutter shock by 90%, an attempt to mitigate the shutter-induced softness we saw in previous GX-models. The camera relies on contrast detect autofocus with the help of Panasonic''s Depth from Defocus technology when Panasonic lenses are used. Naturally 4K/30p/24p video is present with all of the affiliated 4K Photo Modes, including two new ones: Auto Marking and Sequence Composition. Auto Marking allows the camera to identify movement in a 4K clip and set a marker to quickly jump to the action, and Sequence Composition makes it easy to create composite images of action in-camera. In-body 5-axis stabilization combines with dual-axis optical stabilization, resulting in a claimed 4-stop reduction in shake. Wi-Fi and Bluetooth are available for quick image sharing.'

    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: Street photographers, travel photographers who don't mind carrying an extra battery with them, enthusiasts that enjoy abundant controls and those who want great JPEGs right out of the camera.
        NotSoGoodFor: Hardcore landscape and sports shooters that may need greater dynamic range, resolution and burst speeds.
        Conclusion: With its compact size, robust feature set, abundant controls and overall responsiveness, the Panasonic Lumix DC-GX9 is a great camera for all kinds of photographers. The trick tilting viewfinder is a neat touch (though we wish it were larger), and limited battery life remains a sticking point. But impressive in-body image stabilization, a pleasing JPEG engine and good quality 4K capture mean the Lumix GX9 is a camera we can easily recommend.
