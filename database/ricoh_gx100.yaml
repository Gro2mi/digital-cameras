ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The GX100 has several features to set it apart from the majority of 10MP compacts, most interestingly a 3x zoom lens with a true wideangle capability, covering a range equivalent to 24-72mm on a 35mm camera. The GX100 is also the world's first digital compact to offer an (optional) removable electronic viewfinder, which slips into the flash hot shoe and tilts upwards through 90 degrees. Like the GR-D the GX100 offers 'SLR like' control thanks to twin control dials, raw capture (using the 'universal' DNG format) and a high level of customization options. Unfortunately the GX100 isn't quite as good a camera as it thinks it is, because great features and handling cannot make up for a noisy sensor and questionable processing.
