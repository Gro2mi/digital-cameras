ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: 'Manufacturer description: The Pentax K-1 is Ricoh''s first full-frame DSLR. The camera''s full-frame CMOS sensor features 36.4 effective megapixels and no AA filter and is stabilized using Ricoh''s SRII Shake Reduction system. This five-axis shake reduction system is capable of reducing camera shake with a compensation range of up to five shutter steps. SRII also allows the PENTAX K-1 to incorporate other features such as Pixel Shift Resolution, which effectively eliminates moiré without the need for an anti-aliasing filter, increasing sharpness and overall image quality. Also new is the SAFOX 12 autofocus mechanism with 33 autofocus points, and a  Flexible tilt LCD monitor which can be adjusted to the desired angle horizontally and vertically without deviating from the lens’s optical axis, making it easy to shoot at challenging angles. Other significant ''firsts'' are the K-1’s Operation Assist Lights – compact white LEDs that facilitate camera operation in low-light environments, making it easy to change lenses, swap memory cards and adjust back-of-camera controls, and a Smart Function dial that allows photographers to easy select frequently-used functions without going into the LCD menu.'
