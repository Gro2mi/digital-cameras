ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The Lumix DMC-GH3 is Panasonic's largest and most enthusiast-friendly Micro Four Thirds camera yet, and features a weather-sealed (dust/splash proof) magnesium alloy body, include 6 fps shooting (or 4fps with live view) and five customizable function buttons. Video professionals will be pleased to see that the GH3 offers timecode-supported broadcast quality video capable of bit rates as high as 72Mbps.The GH3 has a new (not multi-aspect) Live MOS sensor, three-core Venus 7 FHD processing engine and a new low pass filter. Panasonic claims improvements in high ISO shadow detail, color reproduction and white balance over its predecessor. The GH3 also offers in-camera HDR and multiple exposure image modes, as well as Wi-Fi connectivity.

    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: Anyone looking for top-quality video as well as stills.
        NotSoGoodFor: As a solely stills camera there are better options, both in terms of size and quality.
        Conclusion: The GH3 offers the best video quality of any camera we've ever seen and does a pretty good job of making it available to a wide range of users. This footage is available without external recorders, making it ideal for in-the-field shooting as well as more formal rigged-up setups. It's also a pretty handy stills camera with plenty of external controls, making it an impressively flexible package, overall.
