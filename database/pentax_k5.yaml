ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: Although at first sight the K-5 is virtually indistinguishable from its predecessor the K-7, there is more novelty to be found 'under the hood'. Arguably the most notable new component is the 16.3 megapixel CMOS sensor. It brings with it a higher maximum sensitivity (ISO 51200 in expanded mode, the highest on a APS-C camera so far), faster continuous shooting (7.0 fps vs the K-7's 5.2) and a 1080p full HD video mode.

    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: enthusiast photographers who need a rugged body and and great low light performance.
        NotSoGoodFor: shooters who need the quickest possible access to movie mode.
        Conclusion: The Pentax K-5's compact, solid body, generally well thought-out ergonomics, comprehensive feature set, and excellent image quality, in both still and movie modes make it one of the best APS-C DSLRs currently on the market.
