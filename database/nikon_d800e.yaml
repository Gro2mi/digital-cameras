ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The Nikon D800E is a variant of the D800 that is free from the effects of an anti-aliasing filter. Aimed at studio and landscape professionals the D800E should theoretically begin to rival medium format digital equipment in terms of resolution. In our testing, the D800E matches the D800 in almost all respects, but does offer a meaningful increase in resolution in certain situations. If you're weighing up the D800 and D800E, in our opinion there is no obvious downside to opting for the more expensive model beyond the extra cost. You get better image quality in both RAW and JPEG mode (although diffraction and lens aberrations remove that benefit at certain aperture settings). And color moiré in still images - in the relatively few instances we've encountered it - is typically only marginally more visible in the D800E than it is in equivalent scene elements captured by the D800.

    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: Photographers with medium format experience and expectations who place a premium on obtaining the highest resolution currently available in a 35mm form factor camera. Videographers who can make use of uncompressed video.
        NotSoGoodFor: Professional sports shooters who demand faster frame rates. Videographers for whom moiré removal in post is not a viable option.
        Conclusion: The Nikon D800E, at low ISOs and optimum lens apertures, offers slightly higher resolution than its less expensive sibling, the D800. Its raw files respond impressively to a moderately aggressive sharpening routine, while avoiding visible artifacts. As with the D800, it offers the (somewhat clunky) option to output uncompressed video, but is noticeably susceptible to color moiré in video mode.
