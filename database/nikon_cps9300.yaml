ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The Nikon Coolpix S9300 is a compact, GPS-equipped travel zoom camera. It features an 18X optical zoom lens, 16 Megapixel CMOS sensor, a high resolution 3-inch LCD display, Full HD video recording and, of course, a GPS receiver. The Coolpix S9300 is the follow-up to the S9100, which was introduced last year.As with the S9100 before it, photo quality is where the Coolpix S9300 really stumbles compared to its peers. The camera's biggest problem are its soft and noisy photos (with lots of fuzzy details), which you'll see even at the base ISO of 125. Things get worse rapidly, and we'd say the S9300 is at least a stop worse than the best cameras in this class.

    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: Travelers who want a low-priced, GPS-equipped camera with a nice zoom range, and photo quality best suited for small prints or web viewing.
        NotSoGoodFor: Photographers seeking top-notch photo quality, manual controls, and good low light performance. The S9300 provides none of these things.
        Conclusion: While the Nikon Coolpix S9300 represents an excellent value and offers a nice point-and-shoot feature set, its photo quality is poor relative to the competition, with mediocre low light shooting and below-par battery life.
