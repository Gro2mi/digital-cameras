ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The WG-80 is a rugged camera that's waterproof to 14m/46ft, shockproof from 1.6m/5ft and freezeproof to -10C/+14F. It features a 16MP CMOS sensor, 28-140mm equiv. lens, 2.7" LCD and 1080/30p video capture. Wi-Fi is not available. The only difference between the WG-80 and its predecessor, the WG-70, is the updated six-light LED array on the front of the camera, which is now twice as bright. The camera is available in black and orange.
