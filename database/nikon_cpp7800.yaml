ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The Coolpix P7800 is Nikon's flagship compact camera, and the replacement to the P7700. The main difference between the two is the addition of an electronic viewfinder, which required the removal of the Quick Control dial. Other features are unchanged. They include a 12.2MP BSI-CMOS sensor and a 28-200mm equivalent zoom lens, a relatively long telephoto reach in this class. Full 1080p video is offered, along with 8fps continuous shooting and a fully articulated 3.0 inch LCD.The P7800 provides lots of options for expansion, being compatible with the GP-1 GPS unit, and includes a hotshoe compatible with the full range of Nikon's Speedlight flashguns. Ergonomics are top-notch, with dual command dials for DSLR-like operation along with a generous, textured grip.
