ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The Canon EOS-1D X is the company's flagship professional DSLR. It's built around an 18MP full-frame sensor capable of shooting at up to 14 frames per second (12fps with AF) and offers a maximum ISO sensitivity of 204,800, effectively replacing both the 1D Mark IV and 1DS Mark III in Canon's lineup. Despite looking a lot like previous 1D-series cameras, the X has been extensively reworked and includes more professional video features than any other Canon DSLR.
