ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: Like sister model the L19, the Coolpix L20 is a basic budget camera with bare bones point-and-shoot functionality in an understated body. You do get a 3.6x zoom lens (covering a rather nonedescript 38-136mm range) and a handful of new gadgets designed to provide true point-and-shoot ease of use (including Auto Scene Selector, Smile Mode and Blink Detection) and a 3.0" screen, but that's about it. (April 2009)
