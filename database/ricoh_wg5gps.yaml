ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: 'Manufacturer description: The WG-5 GPS is waterproof to a depth of 14 meters, shock-resistance against a fall of 2.2 meters, dustproof and cold-resistant against temperatures as low as -10 degrees C, and crushproof against weights up to 100kg. The 4x optical zoom lens offers a maximum aperture of F2.0 and 25mm wide-angle coverage making it possible to capture all of one’s surroundings. The 16-megapixel CMOS sensor assures superior image quality whether images are taken underwater or on land. Thanks to the high resolution, 3.0-inch LCD monitor, and anti-reflection (AR) coating, light reflection is suppressed to reduce glare so that it is easy to use outdoors even in strong sunlight. Capturing rich, detailed video is made simple with the WG-5’s HD movie recording mode, which offers H.264 recording at 30 frames per second.'
