ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The Olympus Stylus Tough TG-2 iHS is the latest flagship of its Tough series of waterproof compact cameras. This update to the TG-1 model is now waterproof down to 15m (50 feet), has a 12MP CMOS sensor and a 4x optical zoom lens with a bright f/2.0 maximum aperture on the wide angle. Further rounding out the specifications are a 3.0" OLED rear display, built-in GPS and elevation recording and 1920 x 1080 video output. An optional housing allows you to take it even deeper underwater - up to 45m equivalent water pressure. Additional accessories include a fisheye converter lens and a telephoto converter lens, both of which are still rugged enough to go for a dive.

    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: Outdoorsy people who want a camera that can take good photos underwater or in the mountains.
        NotSoGoodFor: Those who take low light flash photos or shoot frequently in bright sunlight.
        Conclusion: The Olympus TG-2 offers a very rugged body combined with good image quality, a fast lens, superb performance, a full-featured GPS system and plenty of fun extras. Downsides are few, which include issues with panning in movies, highlight clipping and chromatic aberrations in photos, and difficulty seeing the display outdoors.
