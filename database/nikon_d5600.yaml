    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: Family and casual photographers looking for a fairly simple, highly capable camera.
        NotSoGoodFor: Keen enthusiasts looking to take increasing amounts of control. Buyers for whom video is a significant consideration.
        Conclusion: The D5600 is a capable DSLR with an added always-connected system for communicating with smart devices. It does many things well but what should be the cool features aren't as polished as the underlying camera.
