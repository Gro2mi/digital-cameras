ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: 'The Sony Cyber-shot DSC-TX1 is amongst the first Cyber-shots to use one of Sony''s new back illuminated CMOS sensors. According to Sony, its ''Exmor R'' sensor offers low-light performance with approximately twice the sensitivity of traditional image sensors. The sensor has been incorporated into familiar W and T series bodies. The TX1 is a touch screen camera with 4x zoom lens (35-140mm equiv.). Like the existing, conventional CMOS-based HX1, both cameras offer HD video recording and a Sweep Panorama mode. Sony stresses that this latest CMOS technology, combined with the fast lenses and the six-shot layering technology (first seen on the HX1), offers: "an innovative and comprehensive approach to overcoming the challenge of low light photography that have plagued compact cameras for some time.'
