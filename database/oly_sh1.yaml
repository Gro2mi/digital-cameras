ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The Olympus Stylus SH-1 is a compact travel zoom camera featuring a 25-600mm, 24x optical zoom lens, inheriting the style, build, and controls of the PEN system. It promises sharp images throughout the zoom range during stills and video, using Olympus's 5-axis image stabilization system to compensates for camera shake in stills, and a hybrid electronic stabilization system for 1080 60p HD video.The SH-1 also includes built-in Wi-Fi, synchronizing iOS and Android devices via the manufacturer's Image Share app. The touchscreen LCD allows autofocus area and shutter control.
