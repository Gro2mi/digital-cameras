ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The Panasonic Lumix DMC-GM5 takes a page out of the GM1’s book by putting a Four Thirds sensor in an incredibly compact interchangeable lens body with a Micro Four Thirds mount. Unlike the GM1, the GM5 skips the pop-up flash for a built-in 1,166K dot EVF. Other big differences between the two include the GM5’s 1080/60p video recording, additional external controls, as well as an accessory hotshoe. Like the GM1, the GM5 offers a 16MP Live MOS Micro Four Thirds sensor and a 3-inch touch LCD. Features like built-in Wi-Fi and a magnesium alloy body remain unchanged. The GM5 makes changing settings a bit easier with a new click control dial and button layout, leading to a better overall handling experience. Autofocus has also been noticeably improved over the GM1, and video specs have been bumped up to 1080/60p movie recording.Overall the GM5 proves that a tiny camera can be quite feature-rich. As with any small camera design, you ultimately sacrifice some level of ergonomics for portability. But if that does’t bother you, the GM5 is certainly worth your consideration.

    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: Travel and casual daily snapshots, social settings.
        NotSoGoodFor: Fast moving subjects, low light action.
        Conclusion: If small size is a priority, the pint-sized Lumix GM5 can't be beat. It affords creativity and flexibility that you won't necessarily get with a fixed lens camera, and provides a Four Thirds sensor many times the size of those found in not-much-smaller compact cameras. Its built-in EVF and direct controls recommend it to enthusiasts, but its 16MP sensor struggles to compete with high-res APS-C chips in much of the (often cheaper) competition.
