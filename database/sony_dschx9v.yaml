ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The GPS-enabled DSC-HX9 features Sony's newly-developed back-illuminated Exmor R CMOS sensor, and is capable of recording full 1080p60 HD videos. For still photography the HX9 offers 10fps continuous shooting. The HX9 boasts a 16x (24-384mm equiv.) optical zoom lens and a 921k dot display, and it can generate both high resolution panoramics and also 3D images.The Sony HX9V is a very capable camera when it comes to image quality and video, shots are generally sharp from edge to edge, colors are vivid and well-exposed and the video quality is amongst the best of any compact camera we've ever seen. However, much like its predecessor the HX5, its image performance is overshadowed by sluggish operational speed. Slow start-up and playback make the HX9V irritating at times when you are either unprepared for an unexpected photo opportunity or want to review your images while shooting restless subjects such as children or pets.

    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: Shooting full 1080p video in 60p. High-speed shooting modes like 'hand-held twilight' and 'backlit HDR' provide versatility in difficult shooting environments.
        NotSoGoodFor: Slow shooting and playback performance make an otherwise capable camera frustrating to use at times.
        Conclusion: One of the best-specified cameras in its class, the HX9V offers more features than anyone would be expected to use in day-to-day shooting. Image quality from its 16MP sensor is very competitive, although noise-reduction can be somewhat over-aggressive. Our biggest concern is the rather slow operation, which is frustrating in a camera which is otherwise such a fine performer.
