ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The Canon EOS M50 Mark II is a midrange mirrorless camera with a 24MP APS-C CMOS sensor, DIGIC 8 processor and the latest version of the company's Dual Pixel AF. This compact camera, which uses Canon's EF-M mount, offers both a 2.36M-dot OLED viewfinder and a fully articulating touchscreen. It has a number of features for vlogging, including live YouTube streaming, vertical video support and a mic input. 4K video is limited to 24p, does not use Dual Pixel AF and is heavily cropped, however. Images can be shared using built-in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth.

    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: Casual and social photographers as well as videographers who don't require 4K.
        NotSoGoodFor: Videographers and vloggers who want the best 4K video footage.
        Conclusion: The Canon EOS M50 Mark II is a solid option for easily taking stills and video on the go. 4K video quality isn't great, and live streaming limitations are disappointing, but the stills images it churns out are pleasing. The camera is also quite comfortable in the hand, despite its very compact size.
