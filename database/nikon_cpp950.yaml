Video can be captured at 4K/30p, and a mic input lets users capture higher-quality audio.The P950 has a 2.4M-dot electronic viewfinder along with a fully articulating display.

    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: Birding, travel (especially cruises, safaris etc), and those situations where you need to shoot for the moon – literally
        NotSoGoodFor: Landscapes, fast-moving subjects or any situation where critical image quality is more important than zoom range
        Conclusion: The only reason to consider buying the Nikon Coolpix P950 is its lens, which – covering an equivalent focal length range of 24-2000mm – is extraordinary. There are very few cameras that can match the P950's versatility, although you'll get better image quality and more advanced autofocus from several similarly-priced (but less ambitious) compact cameras.
