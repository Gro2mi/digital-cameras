ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: One of a pair of 2007 7.1MP A series digital camersa boasting DIGIC III processors, Face Detection Technology and ISO 1600. The A560 is a fairly predictable upgrade to the entry-level A540, with the A570IS throwing optical image stabilization, full manual control and compatability with add-on lenses into the mix. Both cameras also sport 2.5-inch screens and 4x zooms.
