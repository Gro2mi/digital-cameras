ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The Samsung NX300 looks a lot like its predecessors, the NX200 and 210, but it includes a series of updates that show signs of ever-greater integration between the company's cameras and its smartphones. The NX300 is built around a 20MP sensor that includes phase-detection focus elements to allow a Hybrid AF system for faster focusing. It gains a larger screen than previous NXs - the 3.3" OLED screen is a 16:9 panel with 768k dots (essentially an extended version of the existing screen) - it's also touch-sensitive. A faster processor helps the NX300 hit nine frames-per-second for continuous shooting, and allows 1080p movies to be shot at 60fps. Upgrades to the camera's Wi-Fi should make connectivity simpler than its predecessors.
