ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The Canon ELPH 510 HS (IXUS 1100 HS) - a super-slim compact superzoom in the ELPH/IXUS family. Despite its small size, it manages to fit a 28-336mm equivalent, image stabilized lens in front of its 12.1MP back-illuminated CMOS sensor. It also has a 460k dot 3.2" (8.8cm) touchscreen LCD on its reverse. Unlike most previous Canon ELPHs, it includes the ability to shoot in 16:9, 3:2 and 1:1 image ratios. Beyond that there are the usual Digic 4-powered creative effects such as Miniature and Toy Camera, the ability to shoot high-speed bursts, slow-motion movies and 1080p24 HD capture. The 510 HS is also compatible with a new optional external flash.

    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: Everyday point-and shoot photography
        NotSoGoodFor: Wet weather or intense use, where the unresponsive touchscreen makes it awkward to explore the camera's full feature set.
        Conclusion: The Canon ELPH 510 HS (IXUS 1100 HS) is a slim, stylish compact with a lot to offer both in terms of features and image quality. Our only real concerns relate to chromatic aberrations, which can be a problem around high-contrast scene elements, and its touch-screen interface, which isn't as responsive as we'd like.
