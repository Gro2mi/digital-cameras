ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: Fujifilm has announced the X-A1, its most basic X-mount mirrorless cameras yet. The X-A1 shares a body with the X-M1 but is based around a 16MP sensor with a conventional, Bayer color filter array, rather than the X-Trans design that's been used elsewhere. Despite its lowly position in the lineup, the X-A1 retains the 920k dot tilting rear screen and Wi-Fi offered by the X-M1, yet is being launched with an MSRP of $599 with the XC 16-50mm F3.5-5.6 OIS standard zoom - $100 cheaper than the X-M1 was launched for.
