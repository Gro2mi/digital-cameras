ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: Incremental upgrade to the G7 increases resolution to 12MP, increases screen size, adds raw mode and throws in a few new features. The G9 may be a relatively minor upgrade but it does knock a few of the rough edges off its predecessor and - most importantly - brings RAW capture (and highly usable RAW capture at that) back to the G series. The new screen is nice too, and the handling performance tweaks might not be enough, but they do bring a noticeable improvement. The big issue is image quality - especially at higher ISOs - which is no better than all the budget cameras using the same sensor. The G10, G11 and G12 are far better all-rounder performers.
