ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The Canon EOS 77D (EOS 9000D in Japan) is a midrange DSLR that sits between the Rebel T7i and EOS 80D. It features Canon's familiar 24MP CMOS sensor and uses the company's newest DIGIC 7 processor. Dual Pixel AF is built-in for responsive AF and good subject tracking in live video and movie mode and, for shooting with the optical viewfinder, there's a 45-point all cross-type system. The camera has a fully articulating 3" touchscreen LCD along with an OVF with 95% coverage. It can capture Full HD video at 60p at a max bit rate of 60Mbps. Wireless features include Wi-Fi, NFC and Bluetooth.

    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: Enthusiasts and amateurs who are looking to take more control over their photography, and those looking to capture video with ease.
        NotSoGoodFor: Sports and peak action shooters, videographers who must have the highest quality footage.
        Conclusion: The Canon EOS 77D is a well-rounded and well-sorted camera. The ergonomics are great, Live View performance is superb and Dual Pixel Autofocus continues to impress. The viewfinder is a little on the small side and it still doesn't shoot 4K video, but as an all-around package for the enthusiast photographer, the EOS 77D deserves a look.
