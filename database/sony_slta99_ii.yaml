ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The Sony Alpha a99 Mark II is an 'SLT' camera which uses a semi-transparent mirror that splits light between the sensor and an AF module near the viewfinder, which differentiates it from a traditional DSLR. The a99 II features a full-frame 42MP BSI CMOS sensor, Hybrid AF system with 399 contrast detect and 79 cross-type hybrid points. The camera can shoot at 12 fps with continuous autofocus and 8 fps with live view and minimal EVF blackout, according to Sony. It can capture 4K video (UHD or Super 35) using the XAVC S codec with bit rates of up to 100Mbps. The a99 II offers both S-Log2 and S-Log3 gammas and can output 4:2:2 4K video over its HDMI port.The rugged body is weather-sealed and has built-in 5-axis image stabilization (Sony claims a 4.5-stop reduction in shake.) It features a large, high resolution EVF as well as a tilting non-touchscreen LCD.

    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: High resolution stills shooting in a wide array of situations. Shooters who want both an EVF and dependable battery life.
        NotSoGoodFor: Shooting video with autofocus. Using 3rd party lenses. Those needing accurate focus tracking.
        Conclusion: Even with its video and autofocus quirks, the a99 II manages to be the world's first all-rounder camera capable of both high-resolution and 12 fps burst shooting with AF. Its unique combination of features means that those who doubted SLT cameras should give the a99 II a closer look.
