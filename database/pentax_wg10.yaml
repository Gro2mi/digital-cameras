ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: 'Manufacturer description: With the WG-10 Pentax has created a more affordable waterproof digital camera, one that still withstands depths of 33 feet, as well as the usual drops, dust, cold, and pressure. With a 14MP CCD sensor, Pentax says the camera can produce "poster size" images thanks to its new imaging engine, and can also capture 720p videos. Its 5x lens zooms from 28-140mm equivalent.'
