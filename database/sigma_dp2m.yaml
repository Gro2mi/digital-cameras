ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: Sigma has totally reinvented its DP series of large sensor compacts with the DP2 Merrill. Named after Dick Merrill, inventor of the Foveon sensor, the camera  includes the most recent version of the technology - the 3 x 15MP APS-C sensor first seen in Sigma's SD1. Because it features an APS-C sensor, The DP2M also features a totally redesigned lens - a 30mm F2.8 lens offering a a 45mm equivalent field-of-view.
