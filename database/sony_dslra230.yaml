ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The Sony A230 is the successor to the A200 as the junior partner in Sony's DSLR line-up. The camera has been restyled and offers new ergonomics and an easy-to-use interfaces, but the underlying specification of the predecessor are retained. The A230 comes with a 10MP sensor and while it feature-wise provides all the essentials, there are better specified and more customizable cameras in the entry-level segment. Most notably the A230 is lacking a live-view system. Its high ISO performance is not quite up with the best in class but overall it is a solid overall performer with a feature set that is more than adequate for its very attractive price point.
