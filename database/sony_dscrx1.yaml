ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The Sony Cyber-shot DSC-RX1 is a full-frame compact camera with a fixed 35mm F2 lens. The camera features a 36 x 24mm CMOS sensor and a leaf shutter for near-silent operation. It includes a manual aperture ring and dedicated exposure compensation dial for direct manual control. It can also capture video at frame rates of up to 1080p60 and includes a series of video-friendly features.With a list price of $2800, the RX1 will probably be out of the reach of most photography enthusiasts but If it lives up to its promise, the RX1 could easily become a classic, used by photojournalists and other working pros who need a small, flexible camera with excellent image quality.

    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: The best image quality of any carry-able camera.
        NotSoGoodFor: Fast action or anyone looking for flexibility. Video shooters.
        Conclusion: The RX1 is a small camera capable of astonishing image quality. Its handling marries classic camera ergonomics with a couple of cyber-shot quirks but it's still a lovely camera to shoot with. If a fixed 35mm lens will fulfill any of your shooting requirements, there's nothing to touch the RX1.
