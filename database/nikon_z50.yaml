ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: The Nikon Z50 is a compact mirrorless camera with an APS-C sensor (known as DX-format in Nikon-speak) that uses the company's Z-mount. It uses a 20.9MP BSI CMOS sensor (derived from the D500's) with on-sensor phase detection, but not in-body image stabilization like the full-frame Z6 and Z7. The lightweight Z50 has a touchscreen that tilts downward and a 2.36M-dot OLED viewfinder. It supports face and eye detection, and the Z50 can shoot continuously at 11 fps with continuous AF. The camera can record 4K/30p video, albeit with a 1.5x crop. It has numerous special effects that can be used for both stills and video. The Z50's connectivity includes Wi-Fi and Bluetooth.

    ReviewSummary:
        GoodFor: Travel and everyday photography.
        NotSoGoodFor: Landscapes and high resolution imagery. Team sports.
        Conclusion: The Z50 is a capable and comfortable camera to use, for a wide range of photography. The autofocus system is a little more awkward than it needs to be, but generally it's a hugely competitive camera. If the lenses you want to use exist, it should be on your list of cameras to consider.
