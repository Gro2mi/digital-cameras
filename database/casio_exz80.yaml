ReviewData:
    ExecutiveSummary: Budget model from the  over-populated Exilim range offers the extensive range of gadgets and gizmos we've come to expect from Casio but sticks to the basics when it comes to the important stuff, offering a pedestrian 3x zoom lens and, like most entry-point models, a low resolution screen. Has a smarter, slimmer design than most in this category, but the price is far from the lowest. (April 2009)
